title: Something about energy consumption in mining 
---

<p>Transportation of overburden, within the limits of the open pit surface itself. to internal waste dump and crushing equipment is carried out by dumper capacity from 50 to 70 t, and volume of loading frame. from 30 to 50 m3. Transportation of overburden to the external deposit is carried out by belts with previous crushing of material by crushers. At the present stage of exploitation, six transporters were installed, three of which being permanent and three mobile, in a total length of around 4500 m. The said transportation system also consists of below-level dump stackers and above- level dump stackers having the capacity adjusted to transporters. Coal transportation from open pit mine to crushing and separation plant is also performed by dumpers capacity of 36 t, volume frame. of 26 m’. In this plant classification of coal is made depending on its market purpose.</p><p>Dewatering of the open pit mine is carried out by a system of electrical centrifugal pumps of considerable capacities, due to great inflow of ground and surface waters.</p><p>All other supporting activities are performed on the open pit mine such as: construction and maintenance of roads, development and recultivation of deposits. supply of energy sources, maintenance of plants and equipment. The block scheme of the Portlica coal open pit mine is given in Figure 1 where: TSI. TS2, TS3- transformer stations, SKDI, SKD2, SKD3 – storage of oil derivatives (diesel fuels ect.), SKEK – explosive dumps. CDI – tunks for diesel fuel supply <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/cement-grinding-mill-company.html">zenith grinding plants</a>,
 DE – explosive supply, 0l, 02, 03 – working sites on overburden for internal waste dump. LI, L2, L3, L4 – working sites on coals (overburden) for external waste dump. DR.0 crushers for overburden <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/coal-crushing-production-line.html">coal crushing plant manufacturer</a>,
 UI. U2. U3 – working sites on coal, D.R.U – coal crushers. SEP – coal separation DEP RU – coal waste. DP – dumper. UT – loading machines, loading. BD – bulldozer, GR – grader. Cp – pump station, REC – recipient, R – light. Open pit mine has a complex exploitation configuration with ten developed working sites that are successively activated as per month, quarter and annual production plans.</p><p>Simulation of the working processes is performed according to the planned real exploitation factors for a one past year. As a result of such analysis, daily, weekly, monthly, quarter and annual production balances with total consumption of all kinds of energy that are reached in realization of the production processes with the optimum planned parameters.</p><p>By comparison of balance production parameters obtained by the simulation model and reached in real system, possible solutions of savings and measures for better maintenance of equipment and plants as well as the increase in technological discipline, are determined.</p><p>For simulation model Mr. Vladislav Kecojevic tested a programming packet generating mass and energy balances as per the following categories:</p><p>1.source of supply – place of delivery of excavated resources</p><p>2.distribution and transportation system</p><p>3.machine – loading place</p><p>4.consumer – operating machine</p><p>5.useful energy – type of working process or facility</p><p>Structure of real system within the applied model is defined by a coding system, namely positioning of all the elements relevant for running of exploitation processes.</p><p>The main structure of model is composed of the following functional links:</p><p>1. production systems, machine in operation (RM) – place of loading (UM)</p><p>2. place of delivery (MD), and</p><p>3. consumption- consumer (POT) – equipment (UR) – sours: (IZ) or store house (SKL)</p>As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asImpact crusher,Stone crushing plant,Jaw crushers, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service.
