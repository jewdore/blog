<p>China's mineral industry has made tremendous contributions to the modernization drive of the country in the last 50 years, but in the course of its further advance forward it will face unprecedentedly rigorous challenges and development opportunities and will bear pressures coming from the following four aspects.</p><p>Change One</p><p>In order to achieve the objectives of the 'three-stage' development strategy, the mineral industry is required to provide even more mineral energy and mineral raw materials. According to the tasks set in the 'Ninth Five-Year' Plan and the Program of Long-Range Objectives. Through the Year 2010 both examined and adopted at the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, by the year 2010 the gross domestic product (GDP) should have been doubled over that of 2000, possibly reaching 18 trillion yuan. It is calculated from the percentage (6%) of the total production value of the mining and beneficiation trade at the township level and higher (468.747 billion yuan) in the gross domestic product of 1997 that the production value of the mining and beneficiation trade in 2010 should reach 1.08 trillion yuan, 2.3 times that in 1997. In spite of the fact that China is to take the road of resource-saving development and make every effort to minimize the consumption of energy and mineral resources in the process of industrial production, yet the mineral industry is still required to increase its production by a big margin so as to keep abreast of the rapid development of the national economic construction.</p><p>Change Two</p><p>The pressure brought about by environment protection to the mining production. In the world today environmental protection is the basic requirement of sustainable development as well as the trend of the times. In China environmental protection is taken by the Chinese government as a basic state policy. Mining activities bring about an immense amount of wealth to mankind and provide material resources on which mankind relies for existence and development on the one hand, but cause a considerable negative effect to the ecological environment on which mankind relics for survival on the other hand. In order to protect their own ecological environments, some countries and regions, developed countries in particular <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/slag-crusher-plant-supplier-in-india.html">Slag Crusher Plant Supplier</a>,
 have to close down some of their own mines and resort to developing and utilizing the internal resources of third-world countries to meet their own needs. For instance, the United States of America which consumes over 0.8 billion tons of petroleum annually relies on oil imports from other countries for more than one half of its consumption. Some of China's mining enterprises have been obliged to close down due to environmental problems too. Under such circumstances, if Chinese mining enterprises wish to maintain their survival and seek fresh development, they must conscientiously implement the basic state policy of environmental protection, and do a good job in environmental protection in the process of mining activities so as to keep abreast of the requirement of the sustainable development strategy. china As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as stone production line, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. impact crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com impact crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Change Three</p><p>The pressure brought about to China's mineral ore beneficiation industry by the economic globalization. In the years after the Second World War was ended, particularly in the 90s of the 20th century, the process of global economic integration has been accelerating and the competition between mining enterprises of all countries also has brought about a great pressure to the mining enterprises of China. Moreover <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/mobile-crusher-for-glass-crushing.html">mobile crusher for glass crushing</a>,
 China's forthcoming entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will bring a stern challenge to China's mineral industry. Because there exist weaknesses in the mix of China's mineral resources and difficulties in China's mining enterprises themselves, most mine enterprises will be less potent in competition when confronted with strong international mining industrial groups and transnational corporations, and the law of selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior in the market economic system cannot but bring an immense pressure to China's mining enterprises.</p>
