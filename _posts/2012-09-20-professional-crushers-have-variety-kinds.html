<p>Professional crusher mining machinery industry can be divided into:jaw crusher, hammer crusher, compound crusher, roll crusher,impact crusher, stone crusher, impact crusher machine and so on.</p><p>A jaw crusher: jaw crusher has a great crushing ratio, even granularity, simple structure, reliable working, easy maintenance, low operating costs and economic characteristics.</p><p>2, hammer crusher: (Ring Hammer Crusher) referred to as: hammer broken, mainly applicable to mineral crushing various brittle materials. Broken materials as coal, salt, white, Asian, gypsum, alum, brick, tile, limestone and so on.</p><p>3, Impact Crusher: referred to the impact crusher for hard materials in the crushing, such as the limestone crushing of the cement plant, with large production capacity, discharge size of small advantages.</p><p>4, compound crusher: the (composite broken) for building materials, mining, metallurgy, chemical industry, broken limestone, clinker, coal and other ores. Characteristics: large production capacity; broken than the high, low energy consumption; good sealing and smooth operation; easy maintenance.</p><p>5, the roll crusher: the roll crusher (roll crusher, roll crusher below) for mineral processing, chemical, cement, building materials and industrial sectors in the crushed and crushing medium hardness ores and rocks with . rotary kiln:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>6, impact crusher: also known as Sand, widely used in rock, abrasives, refractories, cement clinker, quartzite, iron ore, concrete aggregate and other hard, brittle materials in the debris, crushing (sand) and HX series impact crusher (sand making machine) sand used in construction <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/oman-copper-crushing-production-line.html">Oman copper crusher</a>,
 road building and gravel excellent fit.</p><p>7, broken blocks for the methods used?</p><p>① Place the block of material between the two planes, to exert pressure block material is broken due to the stress exceeds the compressive strength. This method is suitable for crushing hard materials.</p><p>② The splitting. Block material by the extrusion of the face with a sharp edge, the tensile strength of the squeeze pressure of the surface tensile stress exceeds the bulk material splitting. The tensile strength of brittle materials is much smaller than the compressive strength, it should adopt the split.</p><p>③ broken. Block material to be bent, broken due to the bending strength of the bending stress exceeds the material. In most cases <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/coal-crushing-production-line.html">coal crushing production line</a>,
 the fragmentation of the block material is the combined result of the above methods, the only primary or secondary. In production can be broken according to the nature of the materials (mainly hardness and toughness).</p>
