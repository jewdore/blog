<p>The basic information ofMagnetic Separator</p><p>The Magnetic Separator can separate raw materials with different magnetic rigidities. The machine works under the magnetic force and machine force. TheWet Magnetic Separatorcan separate raw materials with different magnetic rigidities. The machine works under the magnetic force and machine force. Magnetic Separators are designed to recover ferromagnetic materials.</p><p>Three types of Magnetic Separator</p><p>Themagnetic drum separators are available in designs and sizes to provide solutions for all applications. The heart of each separator is the magnetic system with its unique design, which has a proven record of high efficiency.</p><p>The Magnetic Separator can separate raw materials with different magnetic rigidities. Application of magnetic separator:</p><p>The Wet Magnetic Separator can separate raw materials with different magnetic rigidities. The machine works under the magnetic force and machine force.</p><p>The compare between home and broad</p><p>TheChina Magnetic Separators are available in cyclic design with process vessel diameters smaller than 3mm. Magnetic Separator is one kind of efficient equipment for processing fine, feebly magnetic minerals, such as hematite, limonite, wolfram, limonite, and tantalum-niobium, etc. In recent years, it is also more and more applied in purifying quartz, feldspar and nephline. Its magnetic system is a ring-shape chain closed magnetic circuit with energizing coils made of copper tube and cooled internally by water. Grooved plates made of magnetic conductive stainless steel are used as magnetic matrix.</p><p>Everything for the development of the magnetic separator</p><p>The quality of the wet magnetic separator for all to see, the product quality is the vitality of Hongxing quality, Hongxing to establish a comprehensive set of production quality management system, and to quantify management into the system, from product development to product sales are rigorous, scientific professionalism to build customer satisfaction products and services Hongxing production of wet magnetic separator using high-quality ferrite material or composite made with rare earth magnet, tube <u>table</u> the average magnetic flux density of 100 ~ 600mT. According to user needs, providing downstream, semi-countercurrent, counter flow, and other magnetic separation of the different tables. Wet magnetic separator magnetic separator has a simple structure, large capacity, easy to operate, easy to maintain.</p><p>Magnetic separation methods</p><p>All materials possess magnetic properties. Substances that have a greater permeability than air are classified as paramagnetic; those with a lower permeability are called diamagnetic. Paramagnetic materials are attracted to a magnet; diamagnetic substances are repelled. Very strongly paramagnetic materials can be separated from weakly or nonmagnetic materials by the use of low-intensity magnetic separators. Minerals such as hematite <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/mini-rock-crusher-for-sale.html">mini rock crusher suppliers</a> <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/belt-conveyor-machines-classification-and-function.html">Belt Conveyor Machines for sale</a>,

 limonite, and garnet are weakly magnetic and can be separated from nonmagnetic by the use of high-intensity separators.</p><p>Magnetic separators are widely used to remove tramp iron from ores being crushed, to remove contaminating magnetic from food and industrial products, to recover magnetite and ferrosilicon in the float-sink methods of ore concentration, and to upgrade or concentrate ores. Magnetic separators are extensively used to concentrate ores, particularly iron ores, when one of the principal constituents is magnetic.</p>
