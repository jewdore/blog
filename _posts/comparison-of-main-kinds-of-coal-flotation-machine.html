title: Comparison of Main Kinds of Coal Flotation Machine 
---

<p>Mechanical mixing flotation machines, jet flotation machine, and the flotation column are domestic coal preparation plants and are widely used in flotation devices. They have their own characteristics and are applied in separation of different coal fine particles. Of which, jet flotation machine has the following features:</p><p>1. Large capacity</p><p>2. Simple structure and easy maintenance</p><p>3. No mechanical mixing structure and no moving parts</p><p>4. Large air volume and high utilization factor of air volume</p><p>5. Separating as micro-bubbles</p><p>6. In favor of separating coarse particles and others. Air volume is one of separation machine parameters, whose size reflects the function of flotation machine. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as rotary dryer, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. ball mills:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com jaw crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Varieties flotation machines all have their own advantages. According to results of tests, in the same condition <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/small-scale-gold-mining-equipment.html">small scale gold mining equipment supplier</a>,
 the jet flotation machine has the advantages: large capacity, low energy consumption, high Inflatable performance, low drug consumption and other features. The separation effects are better <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/sugar-mill-supplier-in-india.html">sugar mill for sale in india</a>,
 but that results are influenced by the density of materials. Jet flotation machine has blue prospect for development in flotation equipment, so we need do further research and fine out the parameters that influence its separating results. Then we should optimize its structure parameters in order to reach the goal of large-scale and serialization.</p>
