highlight.js http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/<p>Highlight.js highlights syntax in code examples on blogs, forums and in fact on any web pages. It's very easy to use because it works automatically: finds blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it. The library knows 41 languages and is bundled with 16 style themes.</p><p>jquip</p>https://github.com/mythz/jquip
