<p>The maintenance insure longer lifetime ofball mill</p><p>Specifications:</p><p>1. Lubrication to make sure the ball mill to work normal:</p><p>When the ball mill is working, there are many parts touching with each other. To ensure the friction parts in lubrication is vital to the ball mill's service life. Thus it will avoid the dry friction. It has been proved that the machine temperature will increase quickly in a short time; the heat will smelt the parts of the ball mill. Unfortunately, the machine will stocked even it can't work anymore. Then we must guarantee the friction position have good lubrication. The oil flows to the frication part to cover the frication surface to enhance the movement of the machine. Oil plays an important role in the working process.</p><p>2. Good maintenance:</p><p>Having good maintenance can ensure ball mill in perfect state, and exclude the unnecessary troubles in the working process. Every month's maintenance is very necessary. You can examine the main bearings, barrel, reducer, gear, and hollow shaft. According to results, you can make a perfect plan to adjust the machine to ensure it in the best stable.</p><p>3. Other attention matters:</p><p>Besides the above mentioned there are also other factors need to be pay attention. First of all is how to determine the speed of ball mill; secondly estimate whether the ball mill is overload; thirdly, examine the steel ball ratio.</p><p>Ball Mill maintenance standards:</p><ol>·The bearing on the processing of the base is in the same horizontal surface <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/steel-slag-process-production-line.html">Steel Slag Crusher</a>,
 the center spacing tolerances 1 mm, not parallel longitudinal centerline of deviation 0.5 mm, and horizontal deviation of the centerline of 0.5 mm per metre.·Watts Block spherical contact angle should to be uniform. for each 50 ⅹ not less than 50 mm2 <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/cement-grinding-mill-company.html">zenith cement grinding plants</a>,
 1-2; hollow shaft contacting with the Vanuatu should be 90 ° -100 ° every square inch should be no less than 2:00, the Journal and bearing clearance on both sides should approximate the same.·Ball Mill with the front flange cylinder cover should ensure that the co-ordination of good contacts, and no pads, two different hollow shaft axis of less than 0.8 mm tolerance, when the ring gear in connection with the cylinder assembly correction, the thrust should be solid, Hong positioning pin, the radial Gear swing of not more than 0.5 mm axial swing of not more than 0.84 mm.·Mill liner should be installed to their installed Cover, cylinder liner from the population, beginning with the assembly requirements, the screws tight to the uniform, not leaking. There should be no rubber liner with crack, and crevice use the sponge blocked.·Pinion gear with the centerline to centerline parallel, per meter deviation should be not more than 0.2 mm, Top Gear gap 1 / 4 modulus, lateral tooth 1.06 ---- 1.8 mm gap. ball mill tooth surface contact area of should be no less than 50 per cent of long teeth, tooth-40%.·Reducer, motor and the transmission drive shaft coupling should maintain high coaxial, different shaft centerline of not more than 0.3 mm, the center tilt is less than 1 / 1000.</ol>
