Development thus far has been carried out by Jorgen Evens, frontend lead and Wannes De Smet, project lead and backend developer. Of course, we now would like to welcome you in becoming a tester and/or contributor! You can find more information at xen-master.org, to install and configure XenMaster. If you'd like to help and have experience in developing Java and/or Javascript, load the source in your favorite IDE and have at it!If you have any questions at all, we'll be happy to answer them here or through GitHub.We hope to welcome you in using XenMaster!Jorgen EvensWannes De SmetXenMaster
