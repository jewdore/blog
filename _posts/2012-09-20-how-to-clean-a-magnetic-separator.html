title: How to Clean a Magnetic Separator 
---

<p>When you try to clean a manually cleaning magnet, you can simply put a drop cloth or tarp under the magnet and switch the magnet off. Automatically cleaning magnets are designed with a hydraulic or electric motor driven heavy duty rubber belt that constantly rotates to discharge any tramp metal attracted to the magnet face.</p><p>Henan Hongxing magnetic pulleys are often used to replace standard pulleys in conveyor applications. Addition of the magnetic circuit to the pulley adds protection against tramp metal at a minimal cost. Magnetic pulleys are a very effective means of separation as all of the product passes over the pulley at the end of the conveyor and they continuously clean as the return side of the belt leaves the pulley.</p><p>Hongxing is the industry leader in drum separators! We offer exceptional craftsmanship and quality at a lower price. Our drum separators work on the principle of a stationary magnet under a rotating drum and are fully adjustable for the magnet start and stop position. Drum separation is an excellent solution to high volume separation where vertical space is available.

If the chute dimensions are too large for the tramp metal to be removed by just the outside plates, a wedge with plate magnets under it is added at the center of the chute to force all of the product to pass through the magnetic field.</p><p>To manually clean chute separators, simply unlatch and swing open or slide out the plate magnets to wipe them off. Chute separators are also available with stripper plates to facilitate easier cleaning.</p>
