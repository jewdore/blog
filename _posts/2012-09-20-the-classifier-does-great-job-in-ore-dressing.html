title: The classifier does great job in ore dressing 
---

<p>Product Description</p><p>We produce high weir type, single and double spiral, and immersed single and double spiralclassifiers. Our spiralclassifiersare widely used in the distribution of ore in closed circuits withball mills, grading ore and fine slit in gravity mills, grading granularity and flow of metal ore-dressing, and de-sliming and dehydrating in washing. This product features simple structure, reliable working conditions and convenient operation. Because different grains have different specific gravity and sedimentation rates in liquid, this product allows the fine ore to flow in the water <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/zimbabwe-rotation-impact-crusher-supplier.html">Zimbabwe Rotation Impact Crusher</a>,
 while coarse ore sinks to the bottom. ThisScrew classifiercan filter materials and send course materials to the feeding mouth and discharge fine materials from the pipe. The seat of the machine features channel steel material, while the body is armor plated and the spiral axle is made of cast iron for durability. The machine's lifting equipment can be used manually or electronically.Features of Classifier</p><ul type="disc">Custom designed &amp; builtEnergy efficientInline planetary reducer driveState of the art submerged bearing assemblyPowerful hydraulic spiral lifting deviceWide range of applicationEasy to maintain &amp; operateRigid substructure designOptional anti corrosion treatment for tankOver flow collection launderAdjustable weirsContinuous raking<p>China Spiral Assembly and Usage</p><p>The key component of a spiral classifier is the main shaft, which is carefully designed and selected to prevent deflection due to the spiral weight and the thrust load imposed by the spiral during raking. Large diameter, seamless steel, tubular shaft with sufficient wall thickness is used for minimum deflection. Heavy duty cast steel arms are clamped to the main shaft. The spiral consists of sectional circular steel flights bolted to the arms to form. aSpiral separatoris widely used to control material size from Ball Mill in the beneficiation process, separate mineral sand and fine mud in the gravity concentration, and clean mud and water in washing mineral process. This machine has features of simple structure, reliable and convenient operation <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/crawler-mobile-crusher-plant-supplier-in-india.html">crawler mobile crusher in india</a>,
