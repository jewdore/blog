title: Select a Great Milling Cutters is important 
---

<p>Milling cutters that contain their own straight or tapered threaded portion to provide alignment and support for tools shanks are mounted to the milling machine spindle with collets, spindle adapters, and quick-change tooling which adapts the cutter shank to the spindle.</p><p>Consider the following when choosing milling cutters:</p><p>·High-speed steel, stellite, and cemented carbide cutters have a distinct advantage of being capable of rapid production when used on a machine that can reach the proper speed.</p><p>45° angular cuts may either be made with a 45° single-angle milling cutter while the workpiece is held in a swivel vise <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/argentina-mining-equipment-manufacturer.html">Argentina Mining Equipment Manufacturer</a>,
 or with an end milling cutter while the workpiece is set at the required angle in a universal vise.</p><p>The harder the material, the greater will be the heat that is generated in cutting. Cutters should be selected for their heat-resisting properties.</p><p>Use a coarse-tooth milling cutter for roughing cuts and a finer-toothed milling cutter for light cuts and finishing operations.</p><p>When milling stock to length, the choice of using a pair of side milling cutters to straddle the workpiece, a single-side milling cutter, or an end milling cutter will depend upon the number of pieces to be cut.</p><p>Some operations can be done with more than one type of cutter such as in milling the square end on a shaft or reamer shank. In this case, one or two side milling cutters, a fly cutter, or an end milling cutter may be used. However, for the majority of operations, cutters are specially designed and named for the operation they are to accomplish.

The most common methods of holding are clamping a workpiece to the table, clamping a workpiece to the angle plate <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/mini-rock-crusher-for-sale.html">mini rock crusher suppliers</a>,
 clamping the workpiece in fixtures, holding a workpiece between centers, holding the workpiece in a chuck, and holding the workpiece in a vise. Figure 4-25 of this manual shows a variety of mounting and holding devices. Regardless of the method used in holding, there are certain factors that should be observed in every case. The workpiece must not be sprung in clamping, it must be secured to prevent it from springing or moving away from the cutter, and it must be so aligned that it may be correctly machined T-slots. Milling machine worktables are provided with several T-slots which are used either for clamping and locating the workpiece itself or for mounting the various holding devices and attachments.</p>
