title: The information about mining environment 
---

<p>Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, from an ore body, vein or (coal) seam. The term also includes the removal of soil. Mining of stone and metal has been done since pre-historic times. Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials and finally reclamation of the land to prepare it for other uses once the mine is closed. The nature of mining processes creates a potential negative impact on the environment both during the mining operations and for years after the mine is closed. This impact has led to most of the worldâ€™s nations adopting regulations to moderate the negative effects of mining operations.</p><p>Mining is a traditional means of living for our country. Mining gives jobs to the local people and mining provides materials for industry which means jobs for other people, products for Bulgaria, and exports for the country. However, mining is a threat to nature. An example of this is Rhodope Mountain. There are ancient forests there. When copper was found there, it was good for the economy but it also threatened the birds that nest on the rocks or underground.</p><p>The environment surrounding a minesite can sometimes be disturbed significantly through the migration of metals and nonmetals. This often takes place primarily in surface runoff and subsurface groundwater, collectively called minesite drainage. Thus, the science that assesses, predicts, and controls this water-borne migration is environmental geochemistry of minesite drainage or, somewhat shorter, minesite-drainage chemistry.As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asball mill, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service.</p><p>The geochemical effects of mining originate with the exposure of the original, or primary, minerals to air and/or water during mining. This leads to the release, or leaching, of metals and, when sulfide minerals are present, to the generation of acidity. As a result, water passing over or through mine site components contains detectable concentrations of metals and nonmetals. At the same time <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/roll-crusher-equipment-has-potential-market.html">roll crusher manufacturers</a>,
 soluble metal-bearing secondary minerals can accumulate and then redissolve at a later time.</p><p>Many mining companies around the world pay close attention to the chemistry of waters draining from their mine sites. A great deal of effort is put into assessing drainage chemistry by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting water analyses. Prediction of drainage chemistry is another effort, because a company must know whether the chemistry will improve <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/ball-grinding-mill-equipment-in-cement-industry.html">ball grinding mill equipment supplier</a>,
 worsen, or remain the same for the next decades to centuries. Finally, companies initiate control measures for drainage water if its chemistry is unacceptable for discharge to the environment.</p>
