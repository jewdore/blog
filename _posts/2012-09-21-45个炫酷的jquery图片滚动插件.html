1. Agile jQuery Carousel<p>Highly customizable jQuery Carousel plugin so you can build according to your requirements. JSON data format is used to provide easier integration with external data or data from your CMS. Use it for agile web development. This is an all new version written from scratch. JQuery UI effects and the ability to read files on the server are no longer included. New features are added, such as &ldquo;Control Sets&rdquo; which allow for a more customizable setup. Now posted on Github for faster development. Agile jQuery Carousel examples.</p>2. Step jQuery Carousel Viewer<p>Step jQuery Carousel Viewer displays images or even rich HTML by side scrolling them left or right. Users can step to any specific panel on demand, or browse the gallery sequentially by stepping through x number of panels each time. A smooth sliding animation is used to transition between steps. And fear not in taming this script to go exactly where you want it to- two public methods, two custom event handlers, and three &ldquo;status&rdquo; variables are here for that purpose.</p>3. jCarousel Lite<p>jCarousel Lite is a jQuery plugin that carries you on a carousel ride filled with images and HTML content. Put simply, you can navigate images and/or HTML in a carousel-style widget. It is super light weight, at about <em>2 KB in size</em>, yet very flexible and customizable to fit most of our needs.</p>4. jQuery Infinite Carousel Plugin<p>Unlike most carousel plugins which stop when they get to the last image, this one allows the show to go on infinitely without any user intervention.If you have three images you want to display, after the third image has been displayed, the first image will be next. Through some clever JavaScript, images are shuffled around so that it appears as if the carousel is a true carousel and never ends.</p>5. jQuery Carrousel<p>Moodular is a jQuery plugin which allows to create carousel/slider very easily.

Cloud Carousel<p>This jQuery carousel features optional auto-reflections, and the information contained in the Alt and Title tags of the images can optionally be displayed as you hover over each image.</p><p>There are some benefits to doing this kind of thing in JavaScript rather than Flash, not least of which is the ease of integration, small file size, SEO, and inherent degradability/accessibility. Not having another dev-tool in the workflow is another plus.</p><p>The carousel features realistic perspective. Many 3d carousels only apply perspective scaling to the size of the images, not their positions. This results in disproportionate gaps appearing between items as they shrink in the distance which looks odd.</p>10. jQuery Ms Carousel<p>Each carousel can have own look &amp; feel and behavior. Put next/previous button wherever you want or don&rsquo;t put anywhere its up to you. The most important part is; it returns a carousel object and do whatever you want.</p><p>11.
