title: Seasons Influence the Lubrication of Cone Crusher 
---

<p>How we can lubricate cone crusher in different seasons preferably? Cone crusher is kind equipment that crushing varies of rocks and ores. Loaded on the internal moving surface of cone crusher, the friction force will increase with the hardness of materials. So the lubrication work has great significance for cone crusher. However, how do we use lubrication in different seasons better?</p><p>In hot summer <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/cheap-secondhand-cone-crusher-for-sale.html">Secondhand Cone Crusher For Sale</a>,
 lubrication system of cone crusher can adopt the relatively viscous lubricant oil. With high temperature in summer, the viscous lubricant oil will become relatively thin and slippery under the high temperature, and it can adhere to the internal parts that need to lubricate. If lubricant oil is thin, the effects of lubrication in lubrication system will not very well.

Because viscous lubricant oil becomes more viscous in cold winter, it spread on the necessary parts difficultly. However, the relatively slippery oil can reach our goal.</p><p>Due to low temperature in Spring, we advice to adopt the relatively slippery lubricant oil; Fall is hot because of Summerâ€™s high temperature, we advice to adopt the relatively viscous lubricant oil.</p>
