<p>Concentrator <u>Table</u>Introduction</p><p>Concentrator Table is a mine selecting machine for fine materials working by gravity. It is widely used in selection of Tin, tungsten, gold, silver, lead, zinc, tantalum, niobium, iron, manganese <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/gold-mill-flotation-drum-vacuum-filter.html">gold grind mill supplier</a>,
 ferrotitanium and coal. Our company has long history of table concentrator production; we provide variety of table concentrators with high processing capacity, high recovery rate and high enrichment ratio.</p><p>The concentrator table unified the domestic concentrator table and the gravitational mineral separation technology, it has the merits of high enrichment ratio, good classification efficiency, Simplicity of operator, and obtains the final ore concentrate and the final ore one time. Compares with the traditional process, it has the merits of without medicament, energy lowly and convenience management. It has high cost-effective.Concentrator table priceis different from various types.</p><p>Concentrator Table Features</p><p>1. High enrichment ratio,</p><p>2. High separation precision,</p><p>3.
