title: Two kind transformation of ball mil 
---

<p>First, the transformation method</p><p>Can hollow shaft of the original mill removed, reprocessed supporting rolling bearing and the bearing, or the original mill hollow shaft is not removed with precision adjustment jacket <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/roll-crusher-equipment-has-potential-market.html">roll crusher manufacturers</a>,
 the assembly of rolling bearings and bearing housings can be. The original matching motor can be the same, supporting the power factor adjustment device. In addition, the mill the basis of size, the height of the mill center, the transmission mode, available on the premise of constant transformation.</p><p>(1) change the sliding bearing for roll change bearings. Switch to rolling bearing not only the carrying capacity and service life at the same time, 3 to 5 times than the life of sliding bearings, rolling bearing service life of up to 8 to 13 years. Some cement plants have the mill to increase the filling volume of the grinding media production also increased, but the motor power is obviously insufficient, and often the phenomenon of burning electrical, electronics, circuit, this is the reserve capacity safety factor because the motor is only for equipment start-up and special circumstances, short-term applications, and now they are working properly occupied, which will lead to accidents frequently appear. This case the user in a timely manner to change the ball mill main bearings to bearings, the problems will be solved.</p><p>2 using the new advanced the quality Gan Yourun slip. May lose lubrication oil station facilities, fuel economy 80 percent to 90 percent.</p><p>Second, the transformation effect</p><p>Transformation after the mill motor current is decreased by 10% to 20%, due to the reduction of the motor output power of life on the use of all distribution facilities, reducer, gear size will extend <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/iron-ore-jaw-crusher-distributor-in-indonesia.html">Iron Ore Jaw Crusher Supplier</a>,
 but also reduces the sliding bearing temperature rise is too highThe shutdown caused due to main bearing bush-burning stop production, affecting yield.In addition, due to the original mill motor power limit, the filling volume of the cylinder body of the grinding media summary based on actual experience is obviously insufficient.Motor output power was transformed a large surplus is entirely possible increase of 15% to 20% of the grinding media load, this can be achieved not only save power consumption, but also improves the yield of the dual benefits of the mill production after transformation, per tonne of cement power consumption down 5 ~ 6kwh. Some of the original mill rotary concentricity is not good and often bush-burning, stop production to change the tile phenomenon, the transformation of the main bearing, rolling bearing.Rolling with self-aligning, concentricity deviation to the extent permitted, to ensure the normal operation. This is also proven after a lot of use of units, can achieve a good operating conditions. Transformation after the mill oil pollution phenomenon can greatly improve the site sanitary environment.</p><p>After the mill overall economic efficiency of the transformation of a significant small ball mill annual cost savings of thousands of dollars and medium-sized mill annual cost savings of several hundred thousand dollars, large ball mill annual cost savings of nearly one million. Experts and the competent department recommended that the ordinary ball mill gradually in the next few years, technological innovation, promote the use of energy-saving products to be good economic and social benefits.</p>
