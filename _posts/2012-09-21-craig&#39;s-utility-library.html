title: Craig&#39;s Utility Library
---

<p>http://cul.codeplex.com/</p><p>Project DescriptionCraig's Utility Library (or CUL, as in cull because I'm not that creative), was initially designed through a number of projects that I've worked on. Over time I assembled a number of classes to handle various tasks and continue to add a number of items in my spare time. The library is written in C# and uses .Net 4.0 but many of the classes are usable in lower versions. More code can be found on my website:http://www.gutgames.com.For a list of features, take a look at theList of Featurespage. Note that if you're updating from previous versions, this is aHUGEupdate and will break existing code. However the break was needed to push the code to a more manageable state.Source Code RepositoryThe repository has been updated now to Mercurial. Also note that there are repository mirrors available on Bitbucket and Github:BitbucketandGitHubrepositories. I'll be updating all three with changes as I make them.</p>
