title: The six kinds of rotary kiln 
---

<p>Rotary kilnis refers to rotating calcining kiln (also known as rotating kiln), which belongs to thermal equipment.</p><p>Rotary kiln can be divided into metallurgy kiln, chemical engineering kiln, and building material kiln according to its different dealing materials. The building material kiln is mainly used in calcining clinker cement, limestone and porcelain granule. Metallurgy rotary kiln is mainly used for the magnetizing calcining of lean iron ore in iron and steel plant in metallurgy industry, the chromites and josephinite oxidizing calcining  <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/aluminum-flake-powder-production-line.html">aluminum powder production line</a>,
 calcining of dewalquite and clinker aggregate and aluminum hydroxide roasting in aluminum factory; Chemical engineering rotary kiln is used in chemical plant for chromium ore and chromium ore powder roasting. The limestone kiln( activity limestone kiln ) is used for calcining activity lime and dolomite in iron and steel plant and ferroalloy works</p><p>Rotary kiln is the equipment which is widely used for dealing with solid material mechanically, physically and chemically in building material, metallurgy, chemical, engineering and environment protection industries.</p><p>Lime Rotary Lime Rotary Kiln Technical Features:</p><p>1. With advanced structure, the low pressure loss of the vertical preheater can speed up the preheating process, the decomposition rate in the kiln of the preheated limestone can be 20-25%, and can use directly the 10-15mm fine grade limestone.</p><p>2.Both ends of rotary kiln is sealed by combination scale, which ensures the <u>index</u> of air leakage less than 10%. In order to lessen the radiation loss, it adopts compound refractory materials</p><p>3.Round or square vertical cooler with filling type and ventilated area, which make the lime temperature 800 degree celsius + ambient temperature. It is easy to transport, store <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/roll-crusher-equipment-has-potential-market.html">roll crusher supplier</a>,
 and can be preheated the secondary kiln air to above 700 degree celsius , which reduce the moving parts and special materials</p><p>Cement rotary kilnbelongs to the building material equipment.</p><p>Cement rotary is the main equipment in the dry production line of clinker cement. This series of rotary kiln consist of bowl, supporting part, supporting device with catch wheel, gearing rigging, flexible kiln hood, kiln hood and kiln end sealing device, nozzle device and so on. The rotary kiln is higher than the horizon as the whole body is supported by the riding wheel with the catch wheel controlling the up and down move of the kiln body. Besides the main transmission, the transmission system sets auxiliary transmission device which can keep the kiln body move when the main power is off to protect it from bending deflection. The kiln hood and kiln end sealing device adopts advanced technology which ensures the security of the sealing.</p><p>Metallurgy kiln also known as roller kiln</p><p>Metallurgy rotary kiln: It is mainly used in lean iron and oxidized ore magnetizing calcining; the chromites and josephinite oxidizing calcining; calcining of high metallurgy ore in refractory works; calcining of dewalquite and clinker aggregate and aluminum hydroxide calcining in aluminum factory; chromium ore and chromium ore powder in chemical plant.</p><p>The technics of producing zinc oxide by rotary kiln are as follows:</p><p>Crush the zinc charging and the coke coal into powder lot less than 40. Mix the zinc charging with the coke coal pro rata 1:0.30~1.35 evenly and make the mixture into granule with diameter being 8-15 mm. In the end, put the granule into the brick kiln to smelt and produce zinc oxide. This technics greatly saves the coke or fire coal. The product gained by smelting is of fine quality and high productivity.</p><p>At present the production equipment of ceramic sand is industrial rotary kiln. The columnar main kiln body has 2 degree obliquity angle to the level standard and is placed on the carrier roller. The material is sent into the kiln from the high end. As the kiln is doing swivel motion, the material rolls from the high place (kiln end) down to the lower place (kiln hood). Meanwhile in the kiln hood, the nozzle sprays the gas into the kiln to make it blaze fully. The heat produced makes the material change physically and chemically, and the ceramic sand is formed after the material being cooled down.</p>
