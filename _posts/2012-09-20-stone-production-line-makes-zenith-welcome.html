 etc. According to different production we set, the production is usually 50-500 tons / h. It can also configure cone crusher or sand washer being based on the different materials. And they are applied to many kinds of aggregates and artificial sand making operation, such as granite crushing, river gravel sand making, silica crushing, production of construction sand, basalt and limestone. The stone production line is applicable to hydroelectric power, high-speed, building materials, urban construction industry, etc.</p><p>Stone production line successfully applied in limestone, basalt, Rock crushing plant granite, pebbles and other rock crushing process, the quality of the finished product after crushing can be achieved GB14685-2001 standard. Belt conveyor It can provide a qualified aggregate for high road, rail, water, concrete mixing stations and other industries. Production of stone has the features of high degree of automation of production lines, broken large, high productivity, and large capacity. Jaw crusher Working principle of stone production line: Stone line is composed of vibrating feeder, jaw crusher, impact crusher, vibrating screen, Hammer crusher sand washer, belt conveyor, electric control and other equipment.</p><p>To meet the processing needs of different customers, China spiral classifier Henan Hongxing Mining Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd. can offer the cone crusher, dust removal equipment for the users. Large stone by the silo by the vibrating feeder evenly sent to jaw crusher for primary crushing, crushing the stone after the belt conveyor to the crusher for further crushing; after the crushing of stone by the belt conveyor sent to vibrating screen for screening, screening of several different specifications of the stone <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/grinding/trapezium-mill.html">MTM Series Trapezium Mill supplier</a>,
 to meet the size requirements of stone taken from the finished product belt conveyor stockpiles Screw classifiers; does not meet the size requirements of the stones by belt conveyor to feed back impact crusher for re-broken to form. a closed loop many times. Finished size can be combined according to the needs of users and grading, to protect the environment Cone crusher, dust can be equipped with auxiliary equipment. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as ore processing plant, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. ball mill:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com hammer crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>The process description: Large stone was evenly sent to jaw crusher for primary crushing through the silo by the vibrating feeder, the stone after primary crushing was sent to the impact crusher by the belt conveyor for further crushing; after the tertiary crushing of stone was sent to vibrating screen for screening by the belt conveyor, screening of several different specifications of the stone, the stones which meet the size requirements were taken into the finished product stockpiles by the conveyor belt; the stones which does not meet the size requirements of gravel would feed back to impact crusher from the conveyor belt for re-broken to form. a closed loop many times. Finished size can be combined according to the needs of users and grading, to protect the environment, dust it can be equipped with auxiliary equipment.</p>
