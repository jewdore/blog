<p>Ball millis crucial equipment for grinding after materials are crushed. It is an efficient tool for grinding various materials into powder. Ball mill is widely applied in cement industry, chemical industry, new building materials, fire-resistant materials, fertilizer, porcelain and glass industry etc.</p><p>Ball mill is widely used in industrial production of high-fine grinding machine. It is suitable for grinding various ores and other materials. Ball mill is widely used in mineral processing, building materials and chemical industry. Because of work requirements and the strength, ball mill maintenance is very important. Especially the lubricating oil change and maintenance is particularly important. Shanghai Zenith is a professional ball mill manufacturer in China. The is a key equipment to grind the crushed materials, and the ball mill is widely used in powder-making production line including cement, silicate, new-type building material, refractory material, fertilizer, ore dressing of ferrous metal and non-ferrous metal, glass ceramics, etc, and the ball mill can grind various ores and other materials with dry type and wet type. The following will introduce some tips to maintain ball mill.</p><p>1. When the ball mill has worked about a month, all lubrication oil should be released and replaced by new oil. Then ball mill should change oil every six months again.</p><p>2. Lubrication of every lubrication point and oil level should be checked at least once every 4 hours.</p><p>3. When ball mill is working, oil temperature of main bearing should not exceed 55 ℃.</p><p>4. Drive bearing and reducer's temperature does not exceed 55 ℃, the maximum does not exceed 60 ℃.</p><p>5. Large and small gears are working smoothly, there is no abnormal noise. When necessary, you should adjust clearance.</p><p>6. The ball mill runs smoothly, there is no strong vibration.</p><p>7. There should be no abnormal fluctuations in motor current.</p><p>8. Each connecting fasteners is not loose, there is no leaking oil, water and ore.</p><p>9. According to wear, steel ball should be added timely.</p><p>10. If finding an abnormal situation, you should immediately stop grinding to overhaul.</p><p>11. If ball mill liner is worn 70% or 70mm long cracks, they should be replaced in time.</p><p>12. Damaged lining board bolt cause looseness of lining board, it should be changed.</p><p>Or you can do following:</p><p>1. mainly inspect the oil amount, adjust the space between various parts <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/gypsum-powder-production-line.html">gypsum powder production line for sale</a>,
 firm the bolt, replace the impact plate or inspect the wearing of impact plate, mend the feeder;</p><p>2. Every oil site’s state and oil height ought to be checked per 4 hours.</p><p>3. The oil temperature of main bearing ought to be not above 55&#161;&#230;.</p><p>4. The diver bearing and speed reducer’s temperature should be not above 55&#161;&#230; when ball mill is running.</p><p>5. Turning per week to test if the equipment moving parts or around obstacles <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/iron-ore-fine-crusher-crushing-line.html">Iron Ore Fine Crusher Crushing Line</a>,
 and eliminate. Not allowed to stop people around the boot.</p><p>6. Fill the oil according to the setting time and setting position, to be sure the normal running with the machine also to extend its service life.</p><p>7. After a period of usage, all the matching equipments should be looked into in order to be convenient for maintenance and repair.</p><p>8. To replace the worn-and-torn parts such as rollers, rings and shelves. Make sure to fasten connecting bolts, nut collars to fix rollers properly. Be sure to lubricate the various components.</p>
