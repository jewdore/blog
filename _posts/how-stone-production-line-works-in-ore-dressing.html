title: How stone production line works in ore dressing 
---

<p>Brief introduction ofstone production line:</p><p>First the raw materials are regularly conveyed into the elementary-crushing machine by thevibrating feeder, and then thebelt conveyortransfers the elementary products toimpact crusherfor secondary crush. The secondary products will be separated into stone of different sizes by thevibrating screen. The parts not satisfying the needs will be returned to the impact crusher for further crush.</p><p>The stone materials are delivered into thejaw crusherfor preliminary crush by the feeder. Then, the crushed rough stone materials are transported into the impact crusher for further crush by the belt conveyor. Then, the stone materials are separated into different size by the vibrating screen <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/roll-crusher-equipment-has-potential-market.html">roll crusher supplier</a>,
 and the stone, which does not satisfy the required granularity, will return to the impact crusher for crush once again.</p><p>Production processing</p><p>The material is fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder for primary crushing, after crushing; the material will be fed into WKS Simmonscone crusherby belt conveyor for secondary crushing. The fine materials with belt conveyor are sent to the circle vibrating screen for screening different specifications of finished product stone, but not qualified stone will return to the cone crusher.</p><p>ThisStone crushing planthas features of high automation, adjustable size of discharged granularity, high broken ratio, low energy consumption, large output, high uniform. granularity and good shape of the products, and it is suitable for various engineering project constructions, such as highway, bridge and so on.</p><p>Usage and Application</p><p>TheRock crushing plantof our company mainly consists of Vibrating Feeder, Jaw Crusher, Cone Crusher or Impact Crusher, Vibrating Screen, Belt Conveyors and Control System <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/belt-conveyor-machines-classification-and-function.html">Belt Conveyor Machines for sale</a>,
 etc. It is completely capable to crush and screen limestone, marble, granite, basalt, river stone and so on, and produce sand &amp; gravels with various granularities for construction and building industry. We are able to design and manufacture complete crusher plants with capacity from 30tph to 500tph, and to provide optimum and most economical solutions according to customersâ€™ requirements on stone specifications, capacity, application, etc.</p>
