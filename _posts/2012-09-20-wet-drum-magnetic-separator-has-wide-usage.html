title: Wet drum magnetic separator has wide usage 
---

<p>The magnetic separator is useful equipment in mining machinery industry. It can separate the raw materials with different magnetic rigidities. </p><p>The machine works under the magnetic force and machine force. Our Magnetic Separators are designed to recover ferromagnetic materials. The separators are available in designs and sizes to provide solutions for all applications. The heart of each separator is the magnetic system with its unique design <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/used-rock-crushing-equipment-for-sale.html">used rock crushing equipment for sale</a>,
 which has approved record of high efficiency. The Magnetic Separators are available in cyclic design with process vessel diameters from 220 mm to 3,050 mm. Magnetic Separator is one kind of efficient equipment for processing fine, feebly magnetic minerals, such as hematite, limonite, wolfram, ilmenite, and tantalum-niobium, etc. </p><p>Grooved plates made of magnetic conductive stainless steel are used as magnetic matrix. It possesses the following advantages: short magnetic circuit, little magnetic flux leakage, high magnetic intensity, low energy consumption, fine beneficiating results, simple structure and easy to maintain. They have been found widely used in more than 20 mineral processing plants of China. The heart of each separator is the magnetic system. With a unique design it has a proven record of high efficiency. Available in a circular design with process vessel diameters smaller than 3mm, this magnetic separator is an efficient piece of equipment for processing fine magnetic minerals, such as hematite, limonite, wolfram, ilmenite and tantalum-niobium. Recently, this equipment has also been more and more frequently used in purifying quartz, feldspar and nepheline. Wet-type permanent magnetic separator mainly consists of such four parts as cylinder, magnetic system, cell and transmission parts. Cylinder is made of 2-3mm welded and bent stainless steel and the terminal cover is forged aluminum plate which is connected with stainless bolts. The motor drives the cylinder to go round and round through decelerated machine. The magnetic system is open and put in the cylinder. The magnetic piece is installed on the bottom plate with stainless bolt, the axis of magnetic yoke spreads out of cylinder, and there is cranks which are fixed on the end of axis. The angle of magnetic system can be adjusted by pulling the crank, and be fixed with push rod. The working area of cell is made of stainless steel plate, and the other parts of frame. and cell adopt common welded steel. sand washing machine:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com china spiral classifier:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Purpose of Wet Drum Magnetic Separator</p><p>The Wet Drum Magnetic Separator is applicable for wet mineral separation of such materials as magnetite, pyrrhotine, roasted ore and ilmenite, etc. and it is also applicable for iron removal working of such materials as coal <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/aluminum-flake-powder-production-line.html">aluminum flake powder production line</a>,
