<p>Introduction ofimpact crusher</p><p>Impact crusher has come up to advanced national standards. The machine adopts brand-new design conception with modularization, CAD structure and finite element to analyze and produce optimized parts. This series of products can process the material with the side length of 100 to 500mm and the compression strength can reach 350Mpa and have the advantages of big reduction ratio and cubic shape after the crushing of materials. Impact crusher applicable for crushing the semi-hard materials and have big throughput and small granularity of materials. It has a feature of big crushing ratio, high-efficiency crushing, cubic shape, selectable crushing, etc. It is suitable for crushing different compression strength of rocks and is widely used in mining, cement and concrete industries. Usage of Impact crusher</p><p></p><p>Impact crusher (impact breaker) is applicable for various hard and fragile materials, such as limestone, coal, salt, gypsum, alum, brick and tile, etc. The crushing compressive strength of materials should not be in excess of 150Mpa. Impact crusher is mainly used in industries such as cement <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/artifical-sand-making-machine-in-germany.html">Artifical Sand Making Machine In Germany</a>,
 coal separation, electricity generation, building materials and compound fertilizer, etc. And Impact crusher can crush materials with different sizes into equal particle, which favors the next procedure.</p><p></p><p>Operating principle of Impact crusher</p><p>The Impact Crusher consists of an encased rotor carrying swing hammers, whizzerclassifierfor fineness regulation <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/angola-iron-crusher-for-sale.html">angola crusher for sale</a>,
 and Blower Fan mounted on a solid shaft. Raw material to be pulverized enters the crushing chamber through the hopper and automatic rotary feeder. The impact of the hammer on the feed material against the Liner plates reduces it into fine powder. The ground material is carried towards the whizzer classifier for classification and the oversize particles are rejected by the classifier and returns to the crushing chamber for further grinding. The classified material is then conveyed into the cyclone for collection and bagging. A dust collector is provided in the system for ensuring dust free operation and no loss of ground powder.</p><p></p><p>Impact crusher features</p><p>1) High quality chrome hammer, abrasion resistance achieving the advanced level in our country</p><p>2) Specially designing tooth impact plate</p><p>3) Adjustable discharge open</p><p>4) High efficiency</p><p>5) Low power consumption unit</p><p>6) Favorable shape with aggregate and running smoothly</p><p>7) Big reduction ratio</p><p>8) Maximum feeding size is 1.3-1.5m; 3-150mm of discharging size</p><p>9) High fineness of discharging size</p>
