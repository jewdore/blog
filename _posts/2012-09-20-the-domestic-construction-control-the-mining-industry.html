title: The domestic construction control the mining industry 
---

<p>Domestic Environment</p><p>Currently, companies in China construction and mining equipment industry are facing much tougher times in 2009. The collapse of China and worldwide financial markets, the tightening of credit by the international lending institutions and the worldwide economic recession will adversely affect this important industry sector.</p><p>China construction and mining equipment industry has been for many years an international industry. Most China manufacturers, especially the larger ones, maintain global supply chains, import some level of their components from foreign manufacturers, and manufacture a portion of their product lines in wholly-owned facilities all over the world. Most of these companies manufacture the smaller, lower priced products abroad, but continue to manufacture the higher-priced, more specialized products in China manufacturing facilities. Most of the industry continues to perform. engineering and other research and development processes in the United States. Acquisitions and mergers have been and will continue to be fairly commonplace, often involving foreign companies. China companies are also increasingly investing in foreign companies or forming strategic partnerships to increase their competitiveness in foreign markets.</p><p>2012 is a year when the twelfth five year plan of our nation has a strong development. The new rural construction, security housing construction, highway, and railway and water conservancy facilities construction become a top priority. The tendency that our country has a strong support for buildings will certainly increase the demand for raw materials such as cement <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/jaw-crusher-for-barite-crushing.html">jaw crusher for barite crushing</a>,
 sand and concrete and will provide mining machinery industry with new development opportunities.</p><p>In addition, as the policy of development of western regions is promoting continuously, the rich coal and rock resources in the western region will inject new and fresh blood for the industrial development of our country. For this reason, the research and development of highly efficient, energy saving and environmentally friendly crushing equipment <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/iron-ore-mining-machine-in-malaysia.html">iron ore mining machine supplier</a>,
 coal mining and manufacturing equipment has become the magic weapon of the mining machinery manufacturing companies for taking up the western market.</p><p>Induced Gas Flotation is very widely used in treating the industrial wastewater effluents from oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, natural gas processing plants and similar industrial facilities. A very similar process known as dissolved air flotation is also used for waste water treatment. Froth flotation is commonly used in the processing of mineral ores.</p><p>IGF Units in the oil industry do not use air as the flotation medium due to the explosion risk. These IGF Units use natural gas to create the bubbles.</p><p>Process description</p><p>The feed water to the IGF float tank is often (but not always) dosed with a coagulant (such as ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate) to flocculate the suspended matter.</p><p>The bubbles may be generated by an impeller, educators or a sparger. The bubbles adhere to the suspended matter, causing the suspended mater to float to the surface and form. a froth layer which is then removed by a skimmer. The froth-free water exits the float tank as the clarified effluent from the IGF unit.</p><p>Some IGF unit designs utilize parallel plate packing material to provide more separation surface and therefore to enhance the separation efficiency of the unit. With its high quality products such as Rock cone crusher、Raymond mill、Cement rotating dryer、Henan Hongxing mining machinery Co.Ltd has ascended in the front rank of the world in the exporting of mining equipments.</p>
