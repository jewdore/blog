title: My summery about steam dryers

<p>The introduction of steam dryer</p><p>A steam dryer is a conventional dryer with a steam feature. The steam feature will create steam in the dryer independently of the traditional drying cycle. This feature is designed to refresh clothes that might not need to be washed, or to remove wrinkles from a load of laundry.</p><p>How the steam dryer works</p><p>A steam dryer can work in a number of different ways. For example, if you have an article of clothing with a slight odor, or it has just been worn once and you want to wear it again <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/iron-ore-jaw-crusher-distributor-in-indonesia.html">Iron Ore Jaw Crusher Distributor</a>,
 you can toss it into a steam dryer for what is usually a 20-minute or less cycle. The dryer will then produce warm steam to remove odors and wrinkles from the clothing.</p><p>The other way a steam dryer works is at the end of a drying cycle. Clothes dryers work by heating the air around the circulating clothes, which can easily cause wrinkles when the load stops moving. If your dryer has a steam feature, the steam might start at the end of the drying cycle to prevent wrinkles from setting in. Additionally, if you've accidentally left clothing in the dryer for a few hours, or overnight, and they have gotten much wrinkled, running the steam dryer feature for a few minutes is a quick and easy way to remove wrinkles.</p><p>How to choose a good steam dryer</p><p>Choosing a steam dryer can depend on the type of features that are desired. For example, some people may prefer one of many models that include the option of extra tumbling time to prevent wrinkled laundry. Also, certain models must be hooked up to a water supply for steam, while others have a holding tank that can be filled as needed. Many brands also offer a laundry freshening option. Energy efficiency, safety features, capacity, cost, and possible color choices should also be considered when making a purchase.

A wrinkle-reducing feature allows the laundry to continue to tumble in the dryer after the drying cycle is complete. This additional time varies by the manufacturer, usually from two to three hours. This is included because laundry left sitting in a dryer is prone to wrinkles.

 the additional tumbling feature may allow the user more time to remove items before creases set in.</p><p>Generally, two different types of water systems are used in steam dryers. Some models require a connection to water via plumbing. Other units have holding tanks that the owner must fill manually, as necessary. The choice for a holding tank may be important for anyone that does not have a readily available water connection. In other cases, it may be more convenient to have a water supply that does not need to be monitored.</p>
