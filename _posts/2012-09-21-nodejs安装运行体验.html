<p>Refer to official website: http://nodejs.org/</p>1. Building and Installing Node.jsStep 1 - Pick Your Platform<p>Node should install out of the box on Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris.</p><p>With some effort you should be able to get it running on other Unixplatforms and Windows (either via Cygwin or MinGW).</p>Step 2 - Prerequisites<p>Node has several dependencies, but fortunately most of them aredistributed along with it.  If you are building from source you shouldonly need 2 things.</p><p>python - version 2.4 or higher. The build tools distributed withNode run on python.</p><p>libssl-dev - If you plan to use SSL/TLS encryption in yournetworking, you'll need this.  Libssl is the library used in theopenssl tool. On Linux and Unix systemsit can usually be installed with your favorite package manager. Thelib comes pre- installed on OS X.</p>Step 3a - Installing on Unix (including BSD and Mac)<p>Building from source</p><p>Use make to build and install Node (execute the following on the command line)</p><pre><code>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/joyent/node.gitcd nodeexport JOBS=2 # optional, sets number of parallel commands.mkdir ~/local./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/nodemakemake installexport PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH</code></pre><p>If you have any installation problems, look at TroubleshootingInstallation, try an alternate installation method, or stop into #node.js and ask questions.</p><p>Pre-built binaries</p><p>You can also install node from packages: Installing Node.js via package manager</p>Step 3b - Building on Windows<p>Pre-built binaries</p><p>Self-contained binaries are available at node-js.prcn.co.cc</p><p>Building from source</p><p>There are two ways of building Node on Windows. One is over the Cygwinemulation layer the other is using MinGW (GNU toolchain forwindows). See theCygwinand MinGWpages.</p><p>Neither builds are satisfactorily stable but it is possible to getsomething running.</p>Step 4 - Install NPM<p>NPM is a package manager that has become the de-facto standard forinstalling additional node libraries and programs. Here's the quickand easy one-liner for installing on Unix.</p><pre><code># curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh</code></pre><p>To install a library e.g. Express:</p><pre><code># npm install express</code></pre><p>And visithttps://github.com/isaacs/npm fordetails.</p>
