<p>The introduction ofDryer machine</p><p>The mining roasting machine is a kind of high-efficiency ,energy-saving drying machine manufactured by our company after many years study ,on the basis of the successful experience of the similar products at home and abroad .Among a wide range of these drying machine ,this one is one of our flagship product.</p><p>We are on the leading side both in design and manufacture of roasting equipment .It is mainly used to dry the mineral materials ,such as iron ore ,quartz ore etc. Furthermore,China dryers have well adaptability, generally applied to granular and massive ore, and can also roast the cream materials with comparative high humidity and the mineral waste residue.</p><p>China dryer is of many advantages of large capacity, high flexibility, and operational convenience and so on.</p><p>What therotary dryerconsist of</p><p>The dryer is formed by rotary body, lifting blade, driving device, supporting device and sealing ring.</p><p>Which Dryer Machine to Use</p><p>The raw material plate is arranged conveniently to allow adjustable angle positions. The material to be dried is inserted to the rotary cylinder through the raw material plate. Hot air flows within the cylinder causing the separation of water from the material by converting it into vapor which is discharged into the atmosphere. At this point, the material becomes dry.</p><p>RotaryDrum Dryerfor Ore Mining:</p><p>Limestone dryerandCement rotating dryerwidely are used in beneficiation process <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/crushing/double-toggle-jaw-crusher.html">Double Toggle Jaw Crusher</a>,

 etc. Some common process materials : Black trap, Basalt; Granite, River gravel; Bauxite, Hard Rock; Lime Stone, Coal; Iron ore, Maganize ore, coal powder making, Clay rotary dryer. Industrial dryer can reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material. The dryer is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams.</p><p>Working Theory of Dryer:</p><p>The wet materials are transported into the material hopper by thebelt conveyorand bucket elevator, and gets into the feeding terminal through feeding pipe with the aid of feeder of material hopper. The pitch of the feeding pipe should be more than the natural pitch of materials in order to help the materials flow into the dryer successfully. The cylinder of dryer is a rotary cylinder which is oblique slightly. The materials are fed from the relatively higher terminal, heat carrier comes in from the lower terminal, and sometimes the heat carrier and materials get into the cylinder together.</p><p>Along with the revolving of cylinder, the materials move to the lower terminal due to the gravity. When the wet materials move forward, it receives the heat from the heat carrier directly or indirectly. As a result, the wet materials are dried, and discharged out by belt conveyor or screw conveyor on the outlet. There is shoveling plate inside the cylinder in order to shovel materials up and cast it out, to increase the connection surface, to promote drying efficiency, and accelerate the forward movement of materials. Generally, the heat carrier can be hot air and chimney flue.</p><p>After the heat carrier is dried, the materials mingled with air should be collected with cyclone dust collector. If there is need to reduce the content of dust mixed with tail gas, the heat carrier should be subject to bag dust collector or wet dust collector before it is discharged.</p>
