title: Rotary kiln become more important 
---

<p>Rotary kiln belongs to the building material equipment. According to the different processing, rotary kiln can be divided into cement kiln, metallurgy chemical kiln and lime kiln. Among of them, cement kiln is the major equipment of cement industry. Rotary kiln widely used in metallurgy, chemical, refractory and some other industry. </p><p>Rotary kiln is a pyroprocessing device <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/mineral-grinding-equipment-supplier-in-india.html">grinding equipment for sale in india</a>,
 which is mainly used to raise materials to a high temperature in a continuous process, as the common saying – calcinations. It is usually used with the material as follows: cement, lime, refractories, metakaolin, titanium dioxide, alumina, vermiculite <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/mobile-crusher-for-glass-crushing.html">mobile glass crusher manufacturer</a>,
 iron ore pellets，etc.</p><p>According to different material, the rotary kiln can be divided into three types, cement kiln, metallurgy kiln and limestone kiln. The cement kiln is mainly used for calcimine of cement clinker; usually, it has two types -- wet and dry. The metallurgy kiln is used in metallurgy industry and ironworks, such as lean iron ore, chromium ore and ferronickel ore calcimine. The lime kiln, also named active lime kiln, is used for roasting the active lime which is used in steel works and ferroalloy works, and calcined dolomite. </p><p>The basic components of a rotary kiln are the shell, the refractory lining, support tyres and rollers, drive gear and internal heat exchangers. The kiln is made from rolled mild steel plate, usually between 15 and 30mm thick. The refractory lining consists of refractory bricks or cast refractory concrete, aiming at insulating the steel shell from the high temperatures. The support tyres usually consist of a single annular steel casting, machined to a smooth cylindrical surface. And the rollers must support the kiln, allow rotation that is as nearly frictionless as possible. The drive gear is connected through a gear train to a variable-speed electric motor， and have a high starting torque in order to start the kiln with a large eccentric load. The heat exchange in a rotary kiln may be by conduction, convection and radiation, in descending order of efficiency. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as ball mills, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. hammer crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com Ball mills:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Work principles</p><p>Move material in the kiln will follow some basic laws, with the rotation of the kiln, the material is brought to play a certain height, and then slide down the kiln is tilted, the material in the fall at the same time along the axial direction forward for some distance , the formation of the movement speed.</p><p>Moving speed is affected by many factors, for material and the status of the mobile speed. Such as powdered aluminum hydroxide, alumina calcination kiln during release of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other volatiles contained a large number of dehydration and other kiln powder, rapid gasification materials fluidized with air chute conveyor similar conditions, to speed up the movement speed. In another example, alumina, cement clinker kiln burning zone, the material partial melting viscosity, so that the slow movement speed.</p>
