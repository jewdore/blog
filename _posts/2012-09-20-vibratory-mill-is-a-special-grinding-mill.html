title: Vibratory mill is a special grinding mill 
---

<p>Structure</p><p>A vibratory mill having a long, thin milling chamber which spirals upward in a conical arrangement from a center location within a housing to a point at the periphery of the housing. The configuration of the chamber improves the efficiency of the mill and promotes the use of a continuous operation rather than a batch process. Eccentrically mounted rotating weights cause the media and parts to migrate upward from a central receiving position to the periphery of the housing.</p><p>This is the first mill we will consider which does not rely on rotation for the main grinding action. The vibrating mill is a grinding chamber which is filled to about 65 â€“ 80% of its capacity with grinding media such as balls or rods. The chamber is vibrated at a frequency of between 1000 and 1500 times per minute (can be variable speed) by cams or imbalanced weights.</p><p>The grinding action is efficient and thorough. Grinding media material and chamber lining can vary depending on application.</p><p>Vibrating mill can grind hard or soft materials. Maximum throughput is in the order of 20 t.p.h. but feed size should be kept fairly small. Although final product size can be as low as 0.005mm this type of mill is often used for less fine applications. Product size and shape is a function of the time spent in the mill <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/crushing/vertical-shaft-impact-crusher.html">Vertical Shaft Impact Crusher</a>,
 media type and size, and frequency of vibration. Commonly functions as a batch mill.</p><p>Material suitability for vibratory mill: Lime, Calcium carbide, Alumina, Gypsum, Bauxite, Chromitem <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/used-rock-crushing-equipment-for-sale.html">used rock crushing equipment for sale</a>,
 Limestone, Sillimanite, Fluorite, Pigments, Dolomite, Magnesite.</p><p>Vibratory mills are the most versatile line of mills available today for fast, low-cost particle size reduction to sub-micron range. Vibratory mill action achieves higher output per input horsepower; precise control of size and distribution. Product contamination from media and lining wear is virtually eliminated. Maintenance costs are low because of few moving parts and replaceable linings made of abrasion-resistant metal, ceramic or elastomers.</p><p>The Vibratory Mill's unique vibratory motion, coupled with the use of cylindrical media, allows a dense packing of the media bed assuring maximum media surface contact and minimum void area when operated under a low energy condition. Feed materials as large as 300 microns can be reduced to sub-micron sizes.</p><p>In the high energy configuration, feed materials as large as twelve inch agglomerates have been successfully milled and solid particles of a half inch are being reduced to a d50 of less than 5 microns.</p><p>The low energy condition is reserved for wet milling whereas the higher energy mode can be used either wet or dry.</p><p>High Amplitude Wet or Dry Mills</p><p>Vibratory Grinding Mills Size Reduction Equipment Specifically designed for wet or dry grinding, the high amplitude Vibratory mills range from 1 ft3 (36 liters) to 75 ft3 (1,934 liters) of volume.</p>As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as Cement production line,Combination crusher,Dryer machine, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service.
