title: Ball mill can be used widely in gold ore processing

<p>Gold content in the ore is very low. In order to extract gold, you need do gold mine crushing and grinding and pre-enrichment by using dressing method or separate gold from the gold mine. There are lots of methods for gold dressing. Among these, gravity separation and flotation is used more. The two methodsâ€™ difference is that gravity separation plays a very important role in alluvial gold production while flotation is widely used beneficiation method in rock gold mine. Currently about 80% of rock gold mine in China uses this method to select gold.</p><p>In the gold crushing process, raw ore will be sent tovibrating screenafter primary crushing. The top products will be crushed again and then mixed with the middle products for together secondary crushing. The finished products are then screened out. After screening <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/mobile-crusher-plant-manufacturer-in-india-for-sand.html">mobile crusher plant supplier in india</a>,
 the final products will be sent intoball millfor grinding. There can be secondary grinding according to products size.</p><p>For gold ore crushing, we usually choose jaw crusher for primary crushing and stand cone crusher for secondary crushing while short head cone crusher is used for fine crushing. To increase production and equipment utilization factor, Ore Dressing Plant generally follows the principle of more crushing with less grinding to reduce the size of ore into the grinding mill. cone crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Gold mine resources are mainly divided into two categories: one for the vein gold mine, deposits mostly in the mountains, formed by the internal geological forces (mainly volcanism, magmatic, metamorphism), also known as rock gold mine or Endogenous gold; and the other for alluvial gold.</p><p>Gold resources are very rare and gold dressing is not easy. Now we has discovered 98 kinds of gold ore and gold-bearing minerals , of which only 47 species are common, and there are only 10 kinds of minerals which can be directly used in the industries.</p><p>The mainstream gold ore dressing technology is generally through the ore dressing equipment (crusher) to broken gold ore <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/crushing/mobile-crusher-plant-schematic-drawing.html">mobile crusher supplier</a>,
 and then sent into the gold beneficiation (ball mill) to be smashed and grinded. After the gravity separation and flotation, concentrate ore and tailings are extracted, and then by using chemical methods and final smelting, the finished product eventually become gold.</p><p>As the leading mining equipment manufacturer, KEFID can provide you with the gold ore crushing equipment and grinding machine including vibrating screening equipment. Apart from jaw crusher, stand cone crusher, short head cone crusher and ball mill, KEFID can also provide you with impact crusher, VSI crusher, mobile crusher, coal mill, Raymond mill, high pressure grinding equipment and coarse powder grinding mill.</p>
