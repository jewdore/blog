 our independent innovation abilities are not strong and technology absorption is weak. From the status supplied by Department of Commerce, domestic electro-mechanical equipments manufactures patent in the overseas market only account for less 1% of the whole world. And exports volume of the brand equipments is very little.</p><p>Wang Qinhua expressed that we shall support the policy of business driven by technology, take advantage of the innovation base role <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/portable-concrete-crusher-for-sale.html">Portable Concrete Crusher For Sale</a>,
 push forward the transform. of high and new technology industries from assembly processing to independent innovation, and improve the value-added and key competition of high and new technology industries.
