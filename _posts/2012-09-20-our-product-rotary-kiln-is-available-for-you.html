<p>Rotary kilnintroduction:</p><p>Rotary kiln is composed of cylinder, gears, support device, kiln liner and kiln tail sealing equipment, kiln head hood and combustion. Cylinder as heated pivoting part, made of high-quality carbon steel plate, is supported on the support device by type, and there is mechanical or hydraulic pressure catch wheel on the first or some gear in order to control the turning of cylinder. Gearing gyrate is according to process-required rotating speed by ring gear in the middle of cylinder. Because of the need of installation or maintenance, the bigger rotary kiln has auxiliary gears, which makes cylinder gyrate more slowly. To prevent cold air come in and dust overflow, the reliable kiln tail and head sealing equipment is installed on feed and discharge end.</p><p>Rotary kiln application:</p><p>Rotary kiln is Thermal Equipment, heating materials, it is widely used in the fields of cement, Nonferrous Metallurgy, ferrous metallurgy, refractory material, chemical materials, paper making.</p><p>Rotary kiln feature:</p><p>1. Supporting device apply rolling bearing ( few with sliding bearing) to simple the bearing structure to slow down the kiln power consumption and it also improve the maintenance and inspection conditions.</p><p>2. Catch wheel: including two kinds mechanical wheel and hydraulic pressure</p><p>3. Gears: single or double. Control the rotating speed by buncher, DE machine and frequency variable motor. Be reliable, energy-saving, and efficient.</p><p>4. Cylinder type bolster: lower bolster has three types: fixed, zoom and floating. The structure is simple, replacement is convenient and wonâ€™t hurt cylinder.</p><p>5. Sealing equipment: there are many kinds for choice according to kiln models, including air cylinder edge sealing, spring edge sealing, and graphite block sealing and combination for above. The feather is adaptive for cylinder rotating and swing. And sealing effect is very good.</p><p>6. Kiln head hood: including stationary type and flexible type.</p><p>7. Transmission device apply speed adjustable motor with big speed adjustable range, stable operation, easy to maintenance advantages. Our Rotary Kiln has slow disk kiln structure, which is composed by Diesel engine, gearbox etc. It could continue to operate when electric stops, its operation is very flexible and convenient and easy for the kiln maintenance and inspection.</p><p>Application of rotary kiln</p><p>Rotary kiln is the material moves from top to bottom, it includes the material in the calcimine process shrinkage caused by the motion of the materials and the lower part of the material discharging and caused the whole kiln material movement. If the rotary kiln has suitable to expand export, contraction of the material drop impact is very small. Therefore, kiln material velocity depends mainly on the clinker discharging amount, i.e. rotary kiln production. But the movement of materials and the material calcimine rate of speed must adapt, and calcimine rate in calcinations temperature, gas velocity, heat transfer, material particle size, particle size and other factors related to combustion. Therefore, the rotary kiln speculation not only yield blind discharge without considering the material calcimine time is sufficient, the correct approach should be in accordance with the kiln within the specific context of mastering the discharging quantity, to control the material movement velocity and calcinations speed consistent, namely discharge amount and lit speed consistent, can maintain primer stability. Therefore, under the premise of guaranteeing quality, improving output from kiln can be managed to improve the material calcimine rate. Improve the material calcimine rate measures to strengthen rotary kiln ventilation, keep the ball the appropriate particle size and porosity control material, appropriate size, operation stability and maintain primer.</p><p>Some types of rotary kiln</p><p>Rotary kiln for active lime rotary kiln are reliable combined scale sealing. The air leakage coefficient is less than 10% using composite refractory material, to reduce radiation loss.</p><p>Cement rotary kilnis composed of cylinder, gears, support device, kiln liner and kiln tail sealing equipment <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/belt-conveyor-machines-classification-and-function.html">Belt Conveyor Machines for sale</a>,
 Green cement rotary kiln head hood and fuel device.</p><p>The cement rotary kiln belongs to the category of building materials equipment. .Cement rotary kiln cement clinker dry and wet production line main equipment..Cement rotary kiln calcining cement clinker removal, also used to calcined clay, limestone and slag drying; the production of refractory materials, using a rotary kiln calcination of raw materials, make its dimensional stability, strength increase, and then molding processing.</p><p>Thelimestone rotary kilntechnical characteristics: limestone rotary kiln advanced structure <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/impact-crusher-supplier.html">impact crusher supplier</a>,
 low loss of vertical preheater can effectively improve the preheating effect, after the preheat limestone kiln decomposing rate up to 20-25%, and can directly use the 10-15mm fine-grained limestone.</p><p>Clinker rotary kilnis mainly used for chemical clinker calcining, the production of chemical sub-dry and wet kilns produce two types of chemical kiln. Rotary kiln is mainly used in chemical industry, metallurgy steel plant depleted iron ore magnetic roasting; chromium, nickel, iron ore roasting; refractory high alumina bauxite ore roasting plant and aluminum roasting clinker, aluminum hydroxide; chemical chromium ore roasting and chrome ore and other minerals.</p>
