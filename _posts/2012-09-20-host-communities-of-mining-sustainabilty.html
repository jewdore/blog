title: Host communities of mining sustainabilty 
---

<p>From the viewpoint of a community hosting a mining operation it is important that the mining operation itself is not perceived to be sustainable in the sense that it will continue for ver. All mining projects have finite lives. Communities should be well informed so that their expectations are realistic. While there are examples of communities which have been supported by mining operations for more than 100 years, there are many more examples where mining has ceased after much shorter periods. In some cases the associated communities have declined substantially or disappeared totally, as in the case of ‘ghost towns’, the remnants of abandoned mining communities. This is not to suggest that there is anything intrinsically wrong with temporary communities. Many mines are developed in remote, unpopulated areas with no other potential source of employment and, in such cases, there is usually no reason for the community to be sustained, once mining ceases.</p><p>The mining industry itself, however, can be considered as sustainable <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/auxiliary/rotary-drum-screen.html">rotary drum screen for sale</a>,
 as there will always be ores to be mined. This follows because the elements which combine to form. ores remain at or close to the earth’s surface, even after they have been used. When the higher grade, readily accessible ores have been mined, lower grade and/or less accessible ores will be mined. And, in the future, particularly if production costs increase, it can be expected that more and more mineral and metal products will be produced by recycling.</p><p>In many cases, the communities that have developed in association with mining <a href="">artificial stone production line for sale</a>,
 have continued long after mining has finished, albeit on a reduced scale. Examples in Australia include many of the larger inland cities, such as Ballarat and Bendigo, which continue to exist and ultimately to thrive following conclusion of mining. What is important to a community considering becoming host to a new mining project, is that the community itself is sustained during and after mining. This usually means that the pre-existing livelihoods and economic bases are maintained and that additional means of income generation are developed to replace mining, once operations cease.As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asdryer machine, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service.</p><p>Different host communities have different requirements, expectations and aspirations in relation to new mining developments. Impoverished communities are likely to focus on employment opportunities while communities that already enjoy high standards of living will be most concerned to ensure that these standards are not eroded. Typical requirements include：</p><p>* Just compensation for landholders affected directly or indirectly by project development;</p><p>* Direct employment opportunities for working age members of the community;</p><p>* Training to equip local people for direct employment;</p><p>* Opportunities for existing local businesses to supply goods and services to the mining project;</p><p>* Continuation of pre-existing land uses and livelihoods in the areas surrounding the project;</p><p>* Preservation of indigenous cultures;</p><p>* Protection of community values;</p><p>* In the absence of existing local businesses to service project needs, assistance to establish such businesses;</p><p>* Clear and timely information from the mining company in relation to direct employment and business opportunities ;</p><p>* Clear information from the company on risks and hazards associated with the project including use of explosives, traffic and the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances; and associated contingency plans;</p><p>* Input to major decisions of significant concern. Examples include workforce accommodation options, water supply issues, and siting of facilities;</p><p>* Input to community development planning;</p><p>* Development of initiatives to offset negative effects of reduced employment as the project closes, and</p><p>* Close involvement in formulation and implementation of closure plans</p>
