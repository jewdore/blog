<p>Dryer machine：Dryer machine are suitable for a wide variety of products, ranging from granular, powdered and crystalline materials, through to filter cakes and sludges for the food, chemical and mineral industries。</p><p>Application fields：Dryer machine is widely used in the field of building materials, metallurgies, chemical industry, cement and so on. It can dry slag <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/impact-crusher-supplier.html">impact crusher manufacturer</a>,
 coal powder, mining powder, clay, sand, limestone and so on. It is made into rotary body, lifting blade, driving device, supporting device etc. The dryer has advantages of reasonable structure, high efficiency, low energy consumption and convenient for transportation</p><p>Types ofChina dryermachine ：Rotary dryer(Rotary dryers)、Limestone dryer、China dryer（China dryers）、Cement rotating dryer、Drum dryer。</p><p>Rotary dryer ：Rotary Dryers are used to remove moisture from material using hot gases to heat the feed material and to evaporate the water. Rotary Dryers are suitable for drying wide range of materials continuously because of its ability to process material having considerable variation in size and composition.</p><p>Some types of rotary dryer in Hongxing</p><p>Rotary dryer is mainly for dealing with material in large quantities. As reliable operation, operating flexibility, adaptability and large capacity, this dryer is widely used in metallurgy, building materials, food, light industry, chemical industry, coal, medicine and mining industries.</p><p>Application of Rotary dryer machine:</p><p>Rotary Dryer machine is used to dry slag, clay, limestone, Rotary Dryer machine is mainly used for cement <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/roll-crusher-equipment-has-potential-market.html">roll crusher supplier</a>,
 chemical, metallurgical, building materials industries.</p><p>Introduction of Rotary Dryer Machine:</p><p>Dryer also named as Drying Machine and Rotary Dryer. Dryer machine is mainly consist of rotary body, raw material feeding plate, driving and supporting device, etc</p><p>Drum dryer is one of the washing machine, generally after dehydration, used to remove the water from clothing and other textiles. The new product of Henan Hongxing mining machinery Co., LTD. , the Dryer contains a rotating drum, the inside tube driven through the driving belt, the hot air around the roller can be used to evaporate moisture. Drying cylinder are applying the principle of counterrotating, avoiding the cloth twining.</p><p>The traditional cement rotating dryer:</p><p>The traditional dryer always heats air surrounding, and transports the hot air to roller around. The humid air resulted in this procedure will be excluded out, leaving dry air to keep drying . The traditional design does not recover the heat, and is therefore very inefficient. However, the traditional design is simple, reliable, reasonable-priced .</p><p>Steam compression limestone dryer:</p><p>This is a new developing dryer, more advanced than the conventional dryer . Its working principle is not to heat through the hot air. First, the material in roller is heated to 100°C, then resulting damp and hot water vapor. After water vapor escaped out of roller, it will be collected and compressed. Under the pressure of tension, water vapor liquefies and produces heat, sending the heat back to roller, by which it can achieve recycling use of heat. The dryer on this technology, with its efficiency reaching double times of the traditional dryer, the drying time can also be reduced to that half of the traditional dryer.</p><p>Performance characteristics of Indirect heat transfer dryer:</p><p>The indirect heat transfer dryer made by our company is mainly used in building materials, metallurgy,cement plantfor drying of limestone slag, coal powder, slag, clay stone. This dryer is formed by rotary body, lifting blade, driving device, supporting device and sealing ring. The dryer has advantages of reasonable structure, high efficiency, low energy consumption and convenient for transportation.</p><p>Limestone dryer:This machine can dry many kinds of materials which contain moisture, such as coal, coal slurry, slag, industrial waste, and clay stone. They are widely used in building materials, metallurgy, and chemical industry.</p><p>Cement rotating dryer : Cement Rotary Dryer is suitable to dry metallic and nonmetallic mineral, clay in cement industry and coal in coal mine, etc. Cement Rotary dryer can be widely used to dry various materials, and it is simple to be operated.</p><p>Cement Rotary Dryer characteristics ： 1 High dry capacity. 2 smooth rotation. 3 low energy consumption. 4 easy operation.</p><p>Drum dryer :Drum drying is a method used for drying out liquids;Compared to spray drying, drum drying is a more intense heat treatment.The drum dryer is one of our matural products. We sold many sets this dryer to Canada, Tunisia, Vietnam, and we got a good the praise from our customers.</p><p>China dryers characteristics ：</p><p>China dryer machine has been optimized a lot, which possesses the following characteristics:</p><p>1. The internal adopts assembled structure which has improved the accuracy of the equipment and it is easy to transport and install.</p><p>2. According to the characteristics of different fertilizers, we have arranged the second granulation zone reasonably so as to improve the granulation effect.</p><p>3. Adopts assembled hoist board so as to exchange heat fully and lower the energy consumption.</p><p>4. Temperature induction monitor, uniform. vibration and airproof setting, which improve performance and productivity efficiently .</p><p>5. The assorted combustion furnace is a type of energy-efficient and has the characteristics of smaller area, easy regulation and equipped with greenhouse.</p>
