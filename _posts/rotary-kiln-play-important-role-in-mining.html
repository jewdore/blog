<p>Introduction to the Kilnï¼š</p><p>Rotary kilnalso called bauxite rotary kiln,magnesia rotary kiln,zinc oxide rotary kiln</p><p>Kaolin with the features of high white content,soft texture, easy to disperse and suspend in the water, fine plasticity, high cohesive property, good electric insulation property; excellent anti-acid solubility, lower base exchange capacity, and pretty good.</p><p>Internally heated rotary kiln calcining superfine kaolin by medium temperature(950 degree celsius-1050 degree celsius), the technology being maturity and advancement inland <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/diamond-stone-crusher-supplier.html">diamond crushing equipment</a>,
 is a leader in the superfine calcining technology which is energy-saving and of high production.</p><p>Due to the inclination of the cylinder and slow rotation of the material, the materials roll in hoop direction</p><p>On the other hand, the materials move from the high end to the low end, where they are decomposed, burnt, cooled in succession</p><p>Thus they become cement clinker, and are discharged from the low end of the cylinder finally, they enter the cooling device</p><p>The heating source is sprayed into kiln by the burner barrel in the nose area of the kiln the exhaust gas are discharged by the exhaust blower and drained into the the atmosphere by chimmney after exchanging heat with the materials.</p><p>Information to the Metallurgy Rotary Kiln:</p><p>Metallurgy Rotary Kiln is commonly used for heat processing of minerals and aggregates such as lime, cement, and iron ore. With the purpose of achieving consistent quality results, it is important to maintain a uniform. product temperature at the kiln entry, mid zone, and discharge. In most rotary kilns, the challenge with temperature process control is that the temperature sensor must view through flames or heavy smoke and dust. Consequently, when selecting a sensor, the design, wavelength, and alignment are all important considerations.</p><p>Features and Benefits of Rotary Kiln:</p><p>1,Mature and advanced calcination technology;</p><p>2,Low energy consumption and high output Calcining technology;</p><p>3,Productions by dehydration,decarbonization whitening,with stable performance;</p><p>4,Widely used for paper, painting and other industries;</p><p>5,Represents the direction of fine calcined technology development.</p><p>Rotary Kiln working principle:</p><p>Materials enter from the kiln outlet (the high end of the cylinder) into the kiln for calcination. Due to the tilt cylinder and slowly rotating, materials are not only rolling along the circumferential direction but also moving along the axial direction (from high to low), continuing to complete the process. Finally, the clinker enter into the cooler through kiln hood for cooling. Fuel is sprayed into the kiln through the kiln head, and exhaust gas produced by combustion exchanges with material, and then discharges from kiln outlet.</p><p>Widely used in building materials, metallurgy, chemicals, industrial drying slag cement limestone, coal, slag, clay and other materials.The aircraft mainly by the rotary, jan plate, transmission, seals, and other support equipment and components.With a reasonable structure, well-produced, high yield, and low consumption <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/used-gold-mining-equipment-for-sale.html">used gold mining equipment for sale</a>,
