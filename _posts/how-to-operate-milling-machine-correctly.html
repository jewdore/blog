title: How to operate milling machine correctly 
---

<p>Milling is the process of machining flat, curved, or irregular surfaces by feeding the workpiece against a rotating cutter containing a number of cutting edges. The usual Mill consists basically of a motor driven spindle, which mounts and revolves the milling cutter, and a reciprocating adjustable worktable <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/jaw-crusher-spare-parts-sold-in-mining-industry.html">jaw crusher spare parts price</a>,
 which mounts and feeds the workpiece.</p><p>Milling machines are basically classified as vertical or horizontal. These machines are also classified as knee-type, ram-type <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/application-range-of-plate-conveyor.html">plate conveyor</a>,
 manufacturing or bed type, and planer-type. Most milling machines have self-contained electric drive motors, coolant systems, variable spindle speeds, and power-operated <u>table</u> feeds</p><p>Universal horizontal milling machine</p><p>The basic difference between a universal horizontal milling machine and a plain horizontal milling machine is the addition of table swivel housing between the table and the saddle of the universal machine. This permits the table to swing up to 45Â° in either direction for angular and helical milling operations. The universal machine can be fitted with various attachments such as the indexing fixture, rotary table, slotting and rack cutting attachments, and various special fixtures.

Two popular ram-type milling machines are the universal milling machine and the swivel cutter head ram-type milling machine.</p><p>Universal ram-type milling machine</p><p>The universal ram-type milling machine is similar to the universal horizontal milling machine, the difference being, as its name implies, the spindle is mounted on a ram or movable housing.</p><p>Swivel cuter head ram-type milling machine</p><p>The cutter head containing the milling machine spindle is attached to the ram. The cutter head can be swiveled from a vertical spindle position to a horizontal spindle position or can be fixed at any desired angular position between vertical and horizontal. The saddle and knee are hand driven for vertical and cross feed adjustment while the worktable can be either hand or power driven at the operator's choice.</p>
