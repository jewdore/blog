title: iphone下Three20库(From Facebook)的设置使用方法
---

Three20是一个编译的静态类库，在Xcode中的项目实用此类库也非常方便，以下是一些基础步骤：1，从Three20 Git上获取最新文件，在终端命令输入：git clone git://github.com/joehewitt/three20.git,必须确保此项目文件必须有一个固定的存放路径，因为你的项目如果实用此类库，在XCode中需要引用此项目（说明：Git是一种版本控制器，也就类似于源代码管理的东西了，如果还没安装，请到下面网址下载：http://git-scm.com/download ，并进行安装）2，经过一些时间下载数据后打开&#8220;Three20.xcodeproj&#8221;,一般项目想在的默认路径会在&#8221;/computerName/Document/three20&#8243;中的&#8221;src&#8221;文件夹中。把&#8221;Three20.xcodeproj&#8221;拖入到你的项目中的&#8221;Groups and Files&#8221;中的&#8221;Framworks&#8221;类目中。出现对话框后，取消选择&#8221;Copy item&#8221;，在&#8220;Reference Type&#8221;的选项中选中&#8221; Relative To Project&#8221; ,然后点击&#8221;Add&#8221;3,现在你需要在你的项目中关联Three20的静态类库。点击刚才添加的&#8221;Three20.xcodeproj&#8221;,在右侧&#8221;Details&#8221;里选中最后一个复选框4，增加Three20作为dependency，这样Xcode才能正确编译Three20：打開 Targets并双击你的target，在General标签下的的Direct Dependencies按&#8220;+&#8221;后选择Three20，最后按下 Add Target5，在src中找到Three20.bundle并拖入项目，在跳出的对话框中的选中 Create Folder References，取消选择Copy items，Reference Type中选择 Relative to Project6，加入 Core QuartzCore.framework7，加入搜寻路径：打开Project Settings并切换到Build在Search Paths分类找到Header Search Paths于你的项目相对 three20/src 的相对路径 (如 &#8220;http://www.cnblogs.com/../3rdLibrarys/three20/src&#8221;)在Linker分类下找到Other Linkder Flags新增&#8220;-ObjC&#8221;和&#8221;-all_load&#8221;8,最后实用时只需加入#import &#8220;Three20/Three20.h&#8221;就ok了原文地址  http://github.com/joehewitt/three20Three20 is compiled as a static library, and the easiest way to add it to your project is to use Xcode&#8217;s &#8220;dependent project&#8221; facilities. Here is how:Clone the three20 git repository: git clone git://github.com/joehewitt/three20.git. Make sure you store the repository in a permanent place because Xcode will need to reference the files every time you compile your project.Locate the &#8220;Three20.xcodeproj&#8221; file under &#8220;three20/src&#8221;. Drag Three20.xcodeproj and drop it onto the root of your Xcode project&#8217;s &#8220;Groups and Files&#8221; sidebar. A dialog will appear &#8212; make sure &#8220;Copy items&#8221; is unchecked and &#8220;Reference Type&#8221; is &#8220;Relative to Project&#8221; before clicking &#8220;Add&#8221;.Now you need to link the Three20 static library to your project. Click the &#8220;Three20.xcodeproj&#8221; item that has just been added to the sidebar. Under the &#8220;Details&#8221; table, you will see a single item: libThree20.a. Check the checkbox on the far right of libThree20.a.Now you need to add Three20 as a dependency of your project, so Xcode compiles it whenever you compile your project. Expand the &#8220;Targets&#8221; section of the sidebar and double-click your application&#8217;s target. Under the &#8220;General&#8221; tab you will see a &#8220;Direct Dependencies&#8221; section. Click the &#8220;+&#8221; button, select &#8220;Three20&#8243;, and click &#8220;Add Target&#8221;.Now you need to add the bundle of images and strings to your app. Locate &#8220;Three20.bundle&#8221; under &#8220;three20/src&#8221; and drag and drop it into your project. A dialog will appear &#8212; make sure &#8220;Create Folder References&#8221; is selected, &#8220;Copy items&#8221; is unchecked, and &#8220;Reference Type&#8221; is &#8220;Relative to Project&#8221; before clicking &#8220;Add&#8221;.Now you need to add the Core Animation framework to your project. Right click on the &#8220;Frameworks&#8221; group in your project (or equivalent) and select Add &gt; Existing Frameworks. Then locate QuartzCore.framework and add it to the project.Finally, we need to tell your project where to find the Three20 headers. Open your &#8220;Project Settings&#8221; and go to the &#8220;Build&#8221; tab. Look for &#8220;Header Search Paths&#8221; and double-click it. Add the relative path from your project&#8217;s directory to the &#8220;three20/src&#8221; directory.While you are in Project Settings, go to &#8220;Other Linker Flags&#8221; under the &#8220;Linker&#8221; section, and add &#8220;-ObjC&#8221; and &#8220;-all_load&#8221; to the list of flags.You&#8217;re ready to go.
