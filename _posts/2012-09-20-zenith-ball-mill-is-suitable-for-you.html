<p>Here we would like to analyze the differences between ball mill and crusher. The crusher is widely used to crush all kinds of stones. There are many types according to the crushing principle and the size of products. Ball mill is crucial equipment for grinding after the materials are crushed. It is an efficient tool for grinding various materials into powder. Ball mill widely applied in cement industry, chemical industry, new building materials, fire-resistant materials, fertilizer, porcelain and glass industry etc.Crusher could be divided intojaw crusher,impact crusherand hammer crusher. Ball mill could be divided into energy-saving ball mill, batch ball mill and cement mill.</p><p>Compared with crusher, ball mill has some advantages:</p><p>Ball mill is stable and with easy structure. It can grind all kinds of hard materials .We can get the desired grinding fineness because of the mixing function of the material is fine.</p><p>Compared with crusher, ball mill has some disadvantages</p><p>The energy consumption of ball mill is high. The noise of ball mill is loud because of the large size and heavy body. The material is easy to attach to the ball mill, when grinding higher moisture content of the material, so the material moisture content could not exceed 3% generally.</p><p>The amount of fluid output determined its measurement capacity to some degree. Under certain area of the effective diaphragm, volume flow direct ratio of fluid output pump and stroke length L with stroke frequency. cone crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>When the measurement media and the work pressure is determined ,we should adjust the stroke length L and stroke frequency F in order to achieve the two-dimensional adjustment of dryer output.</p><p>Although the stroke length and frequency can be used as the manipulated variable quantum, we generally should consider the stroke length as coarse variable quantum and the stroke efficiency as fine variable quantum in engineering application.</p><p>We should adjust the stroke length to a fixed value, and then change its frequency to achieve fine-tuning <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/steel-slag-process-production-line.html">Steel Slag Crusher</a>,
 which could increase the flexibility of adjustment. Under relative simple applications, you can also set the stroke length manually and consider the stroke frequency as the adjustable variable quantum, which simplifies the system.</p><p>It could carry out dry and wet millings on different materials. Limestone ball mill is a mineral processing machine for milling the materials into powders after they are crushed. It is widely applied to the production of cements, silicate products <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/mobile-crusher-plant-manufacturer-in-india-for-sand.html">mobile crusher plant manufacturer in india</a>,
 building materials, fireproof materials, fertilizers, glass, ceramics as well as nonferrous and ferrous metal processing industries.</p>
