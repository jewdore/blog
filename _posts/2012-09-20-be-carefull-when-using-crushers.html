title: Be carefull when using crushers 
---

<p>Cone crushersare normally used as a secondary crusher but can be used as a primary crusher if used in processing a sand and gravel deposit.Cone crusheris widely applied in metallurgical, construction, road building, chemical and phosphatic industry. Cone crusher is suitable for hard and mid-hard rocks and ores, such as iron ores, copper ores, limestone, quartz, granite, gritstone, etc.</p><p>In the cone crushers market, some users selected to buy used cone crusher, because the used cone crusher has a lower price. But there are many problems when using used cone crusher. It is more difficult to determine the condition of cone crushers thanjaw crushers. There are also bearings and bushings that cannot be seen. It also use various seals that cannot be seen wear and harden with time. It is important to find out some history of application, maintenance and repair history, but many used cone crushers donâ€™t have these. As a commonly applied crushing machine,impact crusherenjoys high popularity. We of course are all very familiar with this machine. This time, I will talk about the installation and debugging of it.</p><p>Impact breakermake use of impact force to broken materials. Its characteristic is small, simple structure, high broken rito (up to 40), less energy consumption, big production capacity, product of granularity, and function of selective crushed ore. Impact crusher is good promising equipment. But the chief drawback is plate hammer and impact board is easily wore down, especially for hard minerals. The wearness is more seriously and need to change. At present as some wear-resisting materials come up, impact crusher has already been applied to some metal concentrator.</p><p>Installation</p><p>(1), The impact crusher pump has motor unit with vibration performence, before installation and commissioning, all fasteners shall be tighten. During production operation should also check regularly and tighten at any time.</p><p>(2) Attention should be paid to installation sense of rotation (in the belt wheel marked spin arrow)can not change.</p><p>(3), After installing motor, you should depend on situation to equipped with the belt cover.</p><p>(4), Impact board and plate hammer gap should decreased gradually according to operation. After adjusting <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/grinding/trapezium-mill.html">MTM Series Trapezium Mill price</a>,
 using hand turn rotor for sevral times to examined if it attacks or not. After the completion of the adjustment, you should lock socket nuts to prevent impact board from loosening and gradually decline and hammer collision, causing an accident.</p><p>Debugging</p><p>1. The rotor has passed balance treatment before leaving factory, the users do not need to do balance test. But the replacement of a hammer and rotor, you should do balanced configuration.</p><p>2. Mainframe. installation should do the balance adjustment, the spindle error is less than 1 mm people/m, master-slave kinematic should in the same plane, adjusting leather belt tightness to moderate and fixed motor.</p><p>3. Check the component installation position if is mobile, deformation, lock all bolts and check the sealing is good or not.</p><p>4. Check the electrical box and tighten situation, adjust delay relay and overload protector <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/autoclaved-aerated-concrete-production-line.html">autoclaved aerated concrete production line</a>,
 connect circuits, test to motor, suitable specifications of the fuse.</p><p>5. Check the hydraulic system action is reliable, have without leakage.</p><p>6. Remove the impact crusher foreign bodies in, hand move rotor, examined for friction, collisions.</p><p>The advantage of using superior river sand is the fact that it mixes quickly with cement and bonds well, generating the plastering operate much less cumbersome for the masons and giving a great finish to the buildings. But however, the continuous mining of sand causes environmental troubles.</p>
