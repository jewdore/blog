利用 HTML(5) + Javascript + CSS就能开发惊人的游戏。下面将要介绍JavaScript游戏引擎包括了：3D、动画、 Canvas、Math、颜色、声音、WebGL等方面。1. General JS Game Engine <p>Akihabara</p> <hr /> <p>Akihabara is a set of libraries, tools and presets to create  pixelated indie-style 8/16-bit era games in Javascript that runs in your  browser without any Flash plugin, making use of <em>a small small small</em> subset of the HTML5 features, that are actually available on many modern browsers.</p>   <p>bdge</p> <hr /> <p>BDGE is a game engine written in Javascript that uses HTML5 Canvas and Audio to create in-browser games.</p> <p> </acronym></p> <p></acronym></p> <p>Canvex: FPS game engine</acronym></p> <hr /> <p>Canvex is an experimental browser-based FPS</acronym> game engine in the HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag, which be believed to work in the following browsers, on any operating system and with no external plugins.</p>   <p>Cocos2D</p> <hr /> <p>Cocos2d-javascript is a 2D game/graphics engine based on  cocos2d-iphone but designed to run in the web browser. It uses the  latest features available in HTML 5 allowing real-time rendering of 2D  graphics without the need for plug-ins such as Adobe Flash.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Crafty</p> <hr /> <p>Crafty is a lightweight, modular JavaScript game engine to easily  produce high quality games. Includes a large variety of components such  as animation, event management, redraw regions, collision detection,  sprites and more.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Diggy</p> <hr /> <p>Diggy is a DHTML Game Engine (DGE).</p> <p> </p>  <p>FlixelJS</p> <hr /> <p>FlixelJS is direct port of Flixel from AS3 to Javascript (HTML5/Canvas). </p> <p>  </p> <p>GameJS</p> <hr /> <p>GameJS is a library for writing 2D games or other interactive  graphics applications for the HTML Canvas. GameJs already provides  sprites, sprite groups (and collision detection between any of the two),  font rendering, image handling, an event loop with keyboard/mouse  support as well as resource preloading, AStar search, javascript server  integration with RingoJs and more.</p> <p> </p>  <p>GammaJS</p> <hr /> <p>Gamma is a new Javascript library which can be used to create 2.5D  platform games for a web browser using the power of HTML, JavaScript,  CSS and WebGL.</p> <p> </p>  <p>gameQuery</p> <hr /> <p>gameQuery is a jQuery plug-in to help make javascript game  development easier by adding some simple game-related classes. It&#8217;s  still in an early stage of development and may change a lot in future  versions. The project is hosted on GitHub (it was hosted on Google Code  before) and a twitter page where you can follow the daily progress of  the development.</p> <p> </p>  <p>gTile: Javascript tile based game engine</p> <hr /> <p>gTile is a browser based game engine entirely in Javascript and  DHTML. A two dimensional tile based view has been chosen for simplicity  and accessibility. Game play is achieved through rich interactions and  behaviors of game objects, rather than fancy graphics or animation.</p> <p>The engine is perhaps best suited to creating adventure and roguelike  style games, but may also be used to create 2D virtual world  representations of communities and geographical locations.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Impact</p> <hr /> <p>Impact is a JavaScript Game Engine that allows you to develop HTML5  Games in no time. Games created with Impact require no browser plugins  or any software installations &#8211; just a modern browser that supports the  Canvas tag.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Isogenic Engine</p> <hr /> <p>The Isogenic Game Engine is a project to create a fully-featured  modern game engine written entirely in Javascript, running on all the  latest web browsers and utilising either HTML Canvas or standard HTML  elements as the draw space.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Javascript 2D Game Engine</p> <hr /> <p>The Javascript 2D Game Engine (for want of a more exciting name), is  more or less just that. It&#8217;s a 2D engine I&#8217;ve developed, in javascript,  with the primary purpose for creating games. It models shapes as rigid  bodies, which can collide and be influenced by forces. Runga Kutta 4 is  used to produce (fairly) stable integration for springs and and charge.</p> <p>Now at version 4, the 2D engine now uses HTML 5&#8242;s canvas tag, and  Google&#8217;s ExplorerCanvas to get it working in IE. The canvas is fairly  widespread these days, so it should be supported fairly widely.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Javascript Game Engine with CSS</p> <hr /> <p>This is a free game engine developed for programming browser based  games. It uses the Javascript language and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  to dress up the page. They run pretty reliably together. Use this  engine to create your own game. This project is intended for beginners,  wanting to learn how to program video games. Better if you&#8217;re a web  designer that knows some CSS.</p> <p> </p>  <p>Javascript Gamelib:Javascript games programming library</p> <hr /> <p>Brent Silby has built upon the official 2.09 version of the Gamelib released by Scott. He says his improvements are:</p> properties for sprites such as jumping, falling, fallspeed, etc. tile handling for backgrounds and platforms. It&#8217;s basically the same  as the sprite module, but (of course) the tiles are not updated on each  cycle to save speed. "This is incomplete but I have used it in my  games," he says. the old V2.09 gamelib modules have been kept in a separate folder  <p> </p>  <p>jGen</p> <hr /> <p>jGen is a game engine build in JavaScript,</p> <p> </p>  <p>jsGameSoup</p> <hr /> <p>jsGameSoup is a Free Software framework for making games for the web  using Javascript and HTML5.

The aim of this project is to create  a lightweight 3D engine with a very low level of abstraction (aka for  dummies). Currently the examples are the documentation. Be aware that  the API may change from revision to revision breaking backwards  compatibility. 3. JavaScript physics engine <p>Box2DFlash </p> <hr /> <p>This is a port of <em>Box2DFlash</em> 2.1a to JavaScript . I developed an ActionScript 3 -to- JavaScript converter to generate the code.</p> <p>There already exists a port to JavaScript called <em>Box2dJs</em>, but  it&#8217;s not up-to-date and you have to import a big amount of JavaScript  files in every project, whereas my version is stored in a single file.</p>  4. Animation JavaScript Framework <p>sprite.js</p> <hr /> <p>The sprite.js framework lets you create animations and games using  sprites in an efficient way. The goal is to have common framework for  Desktop and mobile browsers.</p> <p>sprite.js has been tested on Chromium, Firefox, Android emulator and Opera.</p>  5. Sound JavaScript library <p>SoundManager</p> <hr /> <p>Using HTML5 and Flash, SoundManager 2 provides reliable cross-platform audio under a single API</p>  100% Flash-free MP3 + MP4/AAC where supported.

You could think of it as SVG sans the XML and not be too far off.</p>  <p>CamanJS</p> <hr /> <p>CamanJS is an attempt at providing a simple to use interface for  dynamically manipulating images completely in JS. It strives to provide  much of the basic functionality you would find in something like  Photoshop. By this I mean, image contrast, brightness, levels,  saturation, etc.</p>  <p>CanvasContext2DWrapper</p> <hr /> <p>Wrapper for HTML5 Canvas Context 2D properties and methods, enabling chaining.</p> <p>It&#8217;s intended to be simple, small and not add new functionalities  besides method chaining, it doesn&#8217;t overwrite the native  prototypes/objects and can be used interchangeably with native Context2D  methods/properties, works just as a wrapper to native calls.</p>  <p>canvg</p> <hr /> <p>canvg is a Javascript SVG parser and renderer. It takes a URL to a  SVG file or the text of an SVG file, parses it in JavaScript, and  renders the result on a Canvas element. The rendering speed of the  examples is about as fast as native SVG.</p>  <p>doodle.js</p> <hr /> Doodle-js is An Animation Library for JavaScript. Some of the features:Use the Canvas drawing API with sprites and a scene graph. Event handling and dispatch for objects. Nodes maintain transforms, bounds, and other useful properties. If you&#8217;re coming from ActionScript 3, you&#8217;ll feel right at home!   <p>easel.js</p> <hr /> <p>The new Canvas element in HTML5 is powerful, but it can be difficult  to work with. It has no internal concept of discrete display elements,  so you are required to manage updates manually. The Easel Javascript  library provides a full, hierarchical display list, a core interaction  model, and helper classes to make working with Canvas much easier.</p>  <p>gury.js</p> <hr /> <p>gury.js is a jQuery inspired canvas utility library.</p>  <p>fabric.js</p> <hr /> <p>Fabric.js is a framework that makes it easy to work with HTML5 canvas  element. It is an interactive object model on top of canvas element. It  is also an SVG-to-canvas parser.</p> <p>Using Fabric.js, you can create and populate objects on canvas;  objects like simple geometrical shapes &#8212; rectangles, circles, ellipses,  polygons, or more complex shapes consisting of hundreds or thousands of  simple paths. You can then scale, move, and rotate these objects with  the mouse; modify their properties &#8212; color, transparency, z-index, etc.  You can also manipulate these objects altogether &#8212; grouping them with a  simple mouse selection.</p>  <p>HTML 5 Canvas Library</p> <hr /> <p>A basic HTML 5 canvas drawing library for those familiar with the  java.awt.Graphics class in Java. It also comes with a JavaScript  implementation of the game Breakout to demonstrate using the library.</p>  <p>layered-canvas-library</p> <hr /> <p>The Layered Canvas Library (LCL) is a javascript library that helps  manage objects on the Canvas element. The LCL implements a two tier  layer manager that creates and contains items within it. The layer  manager attaches mouse events to each item contained, and allows the  user to define handlers for each event, per item.</p> <p>The layer manager also allows for each layer contained to be  promoted, or demoted over another layer. The layer manager, and each  layer, and item contained, is defined with a draw function. The draw  function executes user defined code to draw the item, layer, or each  layer contained consecutively.</p>  <p>MooTools Canvas Library</p> <hr /> <p>This library provides functionality to manage and interact with the  content of a html5 canvas element. It emulates layers and items that can  be manipulated and managed and provides mouse-events to the items.</p> <p>This library is inspired by Michael Camden&#8217;s layered-canvas-library  but I made this one a little more compact, skipped some features, added  some and tried to streamline the way the lib is interacted with. It is  built utilizing many features of the MooTools javascript framework which  is responsible for reduced filesize, great OOP and flexible events.</p>  <p>Pixastic</p> <hr /> <p>Pixastic is a JavaScript library which allows you to perform a  variety of operations, filters and fancy effects on images using just a  bit of JavaScript.</p>  <p>processing.js</p> <hr /> <p>Processing.js is the sister project of the popular Processing visual  programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your  data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational  graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any  plug-ins.</p> <p>You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web  page, and Processing.js does the rest. It&#8217;s not magic, but almost.</p>  <p>Rapha?l</p> <hr /> <p>Rapha?l is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work  with vector graphics on the web. If you want to create your own specific  chart or image crop and rotate widget, for example, you can achieve it  simply and easily with this library.</p>  <p>Stackblur</p> <hr /> <p>Stackblur is a Javascript / Canvas based implementation library.</p>  <p>toxiclibsjs</p> <hr /> <p>Toxiclibs.js is a javascript port of Karsten Schmidt&#8217;s Toxiclibs for  Java and Processing. Toxiclibs.js works great with the Processing.js  visualization library for but is not dependent on it. It can be used  with other libraries such as Raphael.js, Three.js or by itself.</p>  <p>Unveil.js</p> <hr /> <p>Unveil is a data exploration and visualization toolkit that utilizes data-driven software design.</p>  7. WebGL <p>WebGLU</p> <hr /> WebGLU is both a set of low-level utilities and a high-level engine for  developing WebGL based applications. WebGLU is designed such that a  developer can focus on the end result with a minimum of fuss and code,  but doesn&#8217;t hand hold developers who want more control. This is achieved  by exposing the raw GL object and also many lower-level functions for  working with it and the WebGL API. 8. Color <p>color.js</p> <hr /> <p>color.js can be used in any ECMAScript environment as it does not  make use of the DOM. color.js is very useful on the server-side and the  client-side, The color.js CSS module defines all of the standard CSS  colors for use in color.js.</p>  9. Math <p>Sylvester</p> <hr /> <p>Sylvester is a JavaScript library designed to let you do mathematics  with vectors and matrices without having to write lots of loops and  throw piles of arrays around.</p> <p>It includes classes for modelling vectors and matrices in any number  of dimensions, and for modelling infinite lines and planes in  3-dimensional space. It lets you write object-oriented easy-to-read code  that mirrors the maths it represents.</p>
