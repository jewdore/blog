title: Two different introduction of mineral separation 
---

<p>The Brief Introduction for Mineral Gravity Concentration</p><p>The gravity concentration method has the advantage of simple structure, low manufacturing cost and less environmental pollution etc, still one of the most important methods for mineral separation. It is widely used to process minerals ore of bigger density difference and is a traditional way to choose the gold, tungsten, sternum, and also for the coal and rare mental(tantalum, niobium, titanium, zirconium etc.)</p><p>In coal washing plant, the gravity concentration, which being the main coal concentration method, take the task of processing 75%~80% coal. It is also used to choose iron, manganese ore and nonmetal ore such as: asbestos, diamond, kaolin etc. For the non ferrous metal (copper, PH, Zn) using flotation concentration, it can also be used to make preliminary separation to rid of larger grade ore or surrounding rock to concentrate the mental to the primary concentration. While the dewatering and separating are almost the necessary procedure in all mining plant. Although the gravity method has less effort to fine grade separating, it has effective effort to handle different kinds of grade material. It also has simple structure, big production capacity, and low manufacturing cost so that it is used by priority at suitable situation.</p><p>The Brief Introduction of Mineral Ore Magnetic Separation</p><p>The magnetic separation has mainly been used to choose the black mental ore. For now, the magnetic separation is still of dominate position in the iron ore plant. Beside the black metal ore, it is with no doubt that the magnetic separation has been widely used for rare metal and nonmetal ore, such as the primary concentration of tungsten &amp; sternum , seashore sand ore, the purity of kaolin and the preliminary separation for asbestos ore. In the process of separation, the magnetic separation is all included along with the de-ironing. In addition, it is also used by different level for blue crystal ore, quartz, red tourmaline, feldspar, nepheline and diorite etc. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asdryer machine, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. sand maker:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com kiln:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>For now, there are many lean ore, and less rich ore, and the quantity of the weak magnetic ore (hematite) are plenty <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/gold-ore-pulverizer-manufacturer-in-india.html">gold ore pulverizer supplier</a>,
 strong magnetic ore (magnetite) less. For weak magnetic lean ore, the most used method are gravity, magnetic, flotation, roasting magnetic and unite processing etc. The roasting magnetic process is made of two procedures magnetic roasting and weak magnetic separating. The roasted weak magnetic iron ore have the advantage of high separation, simple procedure etc by using weakmagnetic separator. We have most important position at this kind of ore.</p><p>Magnetic roasting is the technique to change the weak magnetic iron ore (hematite, limonite, siderite, and iron pyrites etc), into strong magnetic iron ore(magnetic ore or Î³- hematite) using certain condition. For this production, we have made many experiment and study work at the following aspect as: strengthening the roasting magnetic handcraft, the design and improvement for the roasting stove, and handling the magnetic roasting of complex iron ore and roasting technique for powder roasting. We are at the world lead position at the technique.</p><p>The beneficiation plant design the process and equipment model scientifically for the customer according to the plant site survey and ore characteristics. According to the physical, chemical characteristics of different minerals in ores, the process can be of gravity, flotation, magnetic, electronic and magnetic roasting etc after grinding. The confirmation for the equipment model is based on the character of rationality, actual result <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/cheap-secondhand-cone-crusher-for-sale.html">Cheap Secondhand Cone Crusher For Sale</a>,
 applicability, big capacity, low wear-out &amp; operation cost etc. We will provide you the technique assistance at any time and hope to establish a long term win-win cooperation relationship with you in the future.</p>
