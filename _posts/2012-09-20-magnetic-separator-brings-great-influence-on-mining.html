title: Magnetic separator brings great influence on mining 
---

<p>The Wet DrumMagnetic Separatoris applicable for wet mineral separation of such materials as magnetite, pyrrhotine, roasted ore and ilmenite, etc. and it is also applicable for iron removal working of such materials as coal, nonmetal and building materials, etc.</p><p>The machine works under the magnetic force and machine force. Our Magnetic Separators are designed to recover ferromagnetic materials. The separators are available in designs and sizes to provide solutions for all applications. The heart of each separator is the magnetic system with its unique design, which has approved record of high efficiency. The Magnetic Separators are available in cyclic design with process vessel diameters from 220 mm to 3,050 mm. Magnetic Separator is one kind of efficient equipment for processing fine, feebly magnetic minerals, such as hematite, limonite, wolfram, ilmenite, and tantalum-niobium, etc.</p><p>Magnetic separator is used for removing iron powder from the recycling powder particle and magnetic separator are widely used in wood, mining, ceramics, chemical, food and other industries. Magnetic separator is suitable for the separation of materials with a size below 3mm such as magnetite, pyrrhotite, roasted ore, ilmenite and so on. It is also widely used for the iron removal in coal, non metallic minerals, building materials and other materials, which is the most widely used and with high universality machine in the industry. impact breaker:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com dryer:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>The working environment of magnetic separator has always persecuted many manufacturers. As we all know there will produce a large number of powdery objects in the working of the magnetic separator <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/angola-iron-crusher-for-sale.html">angola crusher for sale</a>,
 these objects floats in the air because of the vibration of the magnetic separator. The floating powder cause great harm on the surrounding environment and also have destruction on the surrounding ecological environment as well as cause physical harm to workers in the interior, which not only affect the living environment of people but also reduce the production efficiency.</p><p>At first, let's analysis how the working environment of the magnetic separator is is destroyed:</p><p>1. The separator will produce great noise pollution in the process of its operation; 2. In the separation process of magnetic separator, the crushing ore material is sprayed in the air forming a powdery particles which do harm to the physical health of workers; and in the collection of fine ore and tailings <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/crushing/mobile-crusher-plant-schematic-drawing.html">mobile crusher for sale</a>,
 the operation will cause the ore material flying as well as pollute the air and also result in great waste of resources.</p><p>The solutions: in the design process of magnetic separator, design the discharge device of magnetic separator to closed type so as not to cause material flying in the air, and at the same time improving the engine and using the new magnetic separator engine equipment can effectively reduce noise pollution.</p>
