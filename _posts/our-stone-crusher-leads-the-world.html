<p>A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by mechanical advantage through a material made of molecules that bond together more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or tangent solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil. Querns and mortars are types of these crushing devices.</p><p>Our stone crusher (rock crusher) contains jaw crusher, impact crusher, hammer crusher, cone crusher, vertical shaft impact crusher, stone mill. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as vibrating feeder, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. cone crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com sand maker:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Our stone crushers (rock crushers) are ideally suitable for primary and secondary crushing, with low power consumption and easy maintenance. Every feature of our stone crushers (rock crushers) has been carefully designed to provide superior quality and performance. They are widely used for crushing various materials like stone, granite, trap rock, coke, coal <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/grinding/trapezium-mill.html">MTM Series Trapezium Mill supplier</a>,
 manganese ore <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/oman-copper-crushing-production-line.html">Oman Copper Crushing plant</a>,
 iron ore, emery, fused aluminum, oxide, fused calcium carbide, lime stone, quartzite, alloys, etc. </p><p>Cone crusher is suitable to crush various kinds of ores and rocks of medium or above medium hardness, and cone crusher is of stable structure, high efficiency, easy adjustment, and use economically, etc. The spring safety system of crusher acts as an overloading protection system that allows metals to pass through the crushing chamber so as not to damage the cone crusher. The safety system uses dry oil and water as two kinds of sealed formation to make plaster powder and engine oil separated to make sure reliable performance. The type of crushing chamber depends upon the size of feeding and fineness of the crushed product. The standard type (PYB) is applied to medium crushing, the medium type is applied to medium or fine crushing and the short head type is applied to fine crushing.</p>
