title: The difference made by mining technology 
---

<p>How it all began</p><p>Alexandre Cervinka, Newtrax’s founder and CEO, was just finishing up a contract for the installation of wireless battery-powered sensor networks for the Canadian army when, on the advice of a professor from Université du Québec en Abitibi, he began to give serious thought to the idea of developing this technology for the mining sector.</p><p>Newtrax received financial assistance from Canada Economic Development to develop and implement its commercialization strategy.</p><p>Mr. Cervinka and his partners, Vincent Kassis and Serge Croteau, joined forces with industrial mining application specialists to come up with the MineTrax networking platform. and offer a comprehensive portfolio of solutions to improve safety, productivity, condition-based maintenance and energy management. The platform. is currently patent pending in a number of countries. Newtrax received financial assistance from Canada Economic Development to develop and implement its commercialization strategy.</p><p>Life-saving technology</p><p>Given that GPS technology does not work underground, the MineTrax system is an ambitious feat of engineering.</p><p>“Newtrax Technologies honours the profession by demonstrating the innovative ability of Quebec engineering and by exporting a technology that has a tangible impact on the quality of life and safety of mine workers <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/sugar-mill-supplier-in-india.html">sugar mill supplier in india</a>,
” said OIQ President Maud Cohen, Eng., at the awards ceremony.</p><p>Having reliable wired communication networks in underground mines is a challenge. It is not uncommon for the working face of a mine (the last kilometre, where the miners are working) to be without coverage or for network wires to break in the case of an accident. Conversely, MineTrax’s wireless technology is powered by simple D-cell batteries that can last for years. The system’s decentralized infrastructure, which can be rapidly reconfigured if the nodes (signal-relaying receivers) are damaged, makes it possible to maintain active communication at all times and to quickly launch rescue operations should an accident occur.As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asball mill, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service.</p><p>The miners wear cap lamps that, linked to the communications network, allow them to receive text messages to evacuate or to send out distress signals. These ensure that the exact location of mine workers can be pinpointed, even if they happen to have lost consciousness. It is the best safety system in the world today for underground mine operations. MineTrax also has sensors for the real-time monitoring of air quality in the mine.</p><p>Technology for better mine management</p><p>Apart from its obvious safety features, Newtrax’s technology can also generate considerable savings in energy and costs by providing a dashboard for mine operations. Equipment like heavy machinery and ventilation systems are outfitted with this technology to monitor operations, optimize mining processes, automate and collect <u>data</u>, and ultimately reduce energy consumption based on real-time information. For example, rather than ventilating the entire mine, MineTrax makes it possible to identify the precise location of machinery so that only those areas in use may be ventilated, which can cut energy costs by 40% to 50%. Moreover, data provided on the state of heavy machinery (such as oil level, for instance) can help reduce maintenance costs and avoid equipment failures that can affect the entire chain of production.</p><p>Peer recognition</p><p>Wireless node</p><p>In May 2011, the Newtrax Technologies team was awarded the 2011 Prix Génie Innovation by the (OIQ).</p><p>“Newtrax Technologies honours the profession by demonstrating the innovative ability of Quebec engineering and by exporting a technology that has a tangible impact on the quality of life and safety of mine workers,” said OIQ President Maud Cohen, Eng., at the awards ceremony.</p><p>And it is likely only the beginning for this young enterprise. Its solutions are a major asset for the underground mining industry <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/iron-ore-mining-machine-in-malaysia.html">iron ore mining machine supplier</a>,
 a booming sector with the potential to generate more than $100 million in revenues a year.</p>
