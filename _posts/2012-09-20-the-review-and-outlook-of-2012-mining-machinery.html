title: The review and outlook of 2012 mining machinery 
---

<p>Mining machinery industry as a pillar industry of the national economy occupies an important position in Chinaâ€™s economic construction and social development. In mining, energy, transportation construction,Cone crusherand industrial raw material and other industries <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/knowledge/heavy-hammer-crusher-performance-analysis.html">heavy hammer crusher</a>,
 grinding equipments, milling machines are the basic equipments for construction and materials processing, which aims to provide a steady stream of a large number of basic industrial products and energy, protect the health of the national economy and rapid development. Therefore, mining machinery manufacturing industry is not only the basis to establish a national independent industrial system, but also is an important indicator of a country industrial strength.</p><p>Reviewing the first half year of 2012</p><p>The development level of mining machinery is different. First, the sand maker market is weak in the first half of 2012, and then I hope it will recovery in the second half of 2011. Second the ball mill and rotary kiln market has been hot. From the <u>data</u> of January to May of 2012, China ball mill sales for 5768 sets, an increase of 20.39%.</p><p>Mining Machinery Market Outlook for the second half year of 2012</p><p>The development of mining machinery in recent years <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/autoclaved-aerated-concrete-production-line.html">autoclaved aerated concrete production line</a>,
 overall growth is slow; however, manufacturing and mechanical industry in a country's economic pillars of the role cannot be ignored! 2012 With the continuous development of China's productive forces and improving the states continued emphasis on mining machinery. Mining Machinery has ushered in a good start!</p><p>Eliminate backward production capacity, which provides a good start for the mining machinery. Eliminate backward production capacity is force policy by the government in the beginning of 2012. Compared to the Eleventh Five-Year period, the elimination of backward production capacity expanded in scope, which opens up a broader rode for the development of mining machinery, and is helpful for the mining machinery to the automatic direction! As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asdryer machine, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. hammer crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com mill:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Talents become the backbone of mining machinery</p><p>Premier Wen Jiabao said in his survey of Hunan mechanical industry: it is necessary to attract high-tech talent in to the mining machinery industry. After mining machinery into high-tech talent, of course, the rapid development of mechanical products.</p><p>Various power policy and supports from all quarters, both for the development of mining machinery industry provides powerful stepping stone! I believe mining machinery market will continue to pick up in 2012.</p><p>Mining machinery are taking every step, there were not closely meet the actual production demand of domestic mining, chemical industry, road construction and other industries, market demand for the most fundamental basis, with strong R &amp; D capabilities for the technical support, adhering to the 'science, innovation, development, harmonious 'spirit of enterprise, the introduction of modern scientific management techniques, with many universities and research institutions in close cooperation, precision manufacturing, the times, after years of research, design and development process of a large number of advanced crushing, milling equipment. The company has also established a complete set of internal quality control and management system, rigorous, pragmatic, scientific attitude, quality control, the full realization of the product from production to processing and assembly of finished parts of systematic management.</p>
