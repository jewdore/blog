Other coal miners in surface operations work with the equipment which is used to remove the coal loosened by blasting operations. Coal miners usually train to do this work on the job, although some mining companies offer classroom training opportunities as well as practice opportunities in a non-working mine so that miners can get comfortable with the work.</p><p>When a company needs to mine underground to access coal, a coal miner can be part of the crew which lays out the mine and provides reinforcement and support to prevent collapses. He or she can also work on the teams which actually break up and remove the coal, using heavy equipment rather than the iconic shovels many people associate with coal mining.
