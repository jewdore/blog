After using Backbone.js for a week I could never see myself building any sort of Javascript functionality regardless of size without using Backbone.js or alternatives.I have decided to write a quick introduction for those trying to grasp the mechanics behind it. I am only a beginner also and would love suggestions and tips to improve my code.I am also very curious to hear what you think about how MVC ties into Javascript development and the most effective library you have used for logically organizing your Javascript.Would be great to get a discussion on MVC vs MVVM vs others etc leave comments at the bottom!Also could you implement this example better in another framework?Understanding the Model View Controller ParadigmI have used many frameworks which promote that they use MVC. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen the same fundamental principals implemented the same way.Backbone.js has 4 classes: Models, Views, Controllers and Collections. The Models and Collections class work hand in hand and when combined essentially make up the M(model) of MVC.The main concept I follow when using Backbone.js is to make Views listen for changes in the Model and react accordingly. I would recommend bookmarking the homepage documentation and I perusing the annotated source code.Getting startedI am going to run you through a basic tutorial that should get you on the right path if you are a bit lost like I was when I started.First of all we are going to just setup a basic page and include Backbone.js and Underscore.js(a dependency of Backbone.js)&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;title&gt;I have a back bone&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;    &lt;button id="add-friend"&gt;Add Friend&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;ul id="friends-list"&gt;    &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;script src="http://ajax.cdnjs.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.1.4/underscore-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    &lt;script src="http://ajax.cdnjs.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/0.3.3/backbone-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
