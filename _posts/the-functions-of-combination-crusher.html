<p>Features and Advantages:</p><p>1. High performancejaw crusherplant,impact crusherplant andcone crusherplant.</p><p>2.Vibrating feeder,belt conveyorandvibrating screenare all in one.</p><p>3. Truck traction is convenient for road transit and expanding the working place.</p><p>4. Vehicle installation supporting is easier for equipment to station in the working place.</p><p>It is a common knowledge that jaw crushing machine and impact breaking equipment are applied in stone manufacturing line and sand production line. And generally speaking, these two crushing machines are often configured in the stone and sand-making production line. As a matter of fact, there is another crusher that is also in use in this processing line. That is compound crusher which is playing a role that can also not to be looked down upon in the stone and sand manufacturing process.</p><p>The equipment is just one kind of the many crushing machines. It can not only crusher materials independently, but combined together with other vibrating screening equipment to form. a complete set of sand making production line which has much high production capacity and efficiency.</p><p>Thecombination crushermanufactured by our company is widely applied for medium and fine crushing high hard and super hard materials such as ores, cement, refractory material, bauxite, iron, carborundum, glass raw materials and other materials. It can also be widely used for fine crushing the raw material and clinker in cement manufacturing factories. In the meantime <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/auxiliary/circular-vibrating-screen.html">circular vibrating screen suppliers</a>,
 it can also used for super fine breaking materials with medium hardness such as dolomite and the chamlet, gold, serpentine, high slag, gangue, phosphate rock and it is especially suitable for processing and breaking artificial sand or the highway pavement stone of hard limestone, dolomite, granite, basalt and other rocks and ores.</p><p>This machine is invented at the beginning of the twentieth century and its working principle is taking advantage of the gap between two inverted cones. Because in the whole operation process, the breaking force is pulsatile, and in the breaking process, sometimes it will mix with none-broken objects, such as iron, etc, insurance device will have to be equipped with the machine in order to eliminate such objects and protect the machine from being damaged. According to the different nature of insurance devices, they can be divided into a mechanical spring device or hydraulic spring device (namely insurance cylinder device).</p><p>what are its advantages? Its crushing ratio is big. And the biggest crushing ratio can get to the discharging granularity and can be adjusted freely. The plate hammer and lining board wearing cannot have effects on the crushing ratio. There is no sieve bar. The impact crusher machine cannot be blocked when it crushes the materiel with high humidity and mud percentage. It adopts elastic adjustment structure. If the material which cannot be broken gets into it, it can be discharged automatically <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/india-impact-crusher-spare-parts-supplier.html">Impact Crusher Spare Parts Supplier</a>,
 so the machine cannot be damaged. The bearing is fixed horizontally and its usage life is long. Thisore beneficiationmachine's rotor is special. The rotor body hardly wears when the machine crushes the materiel.</p>
