title: Vibrating feeder widely applied in mining 
---

<p>Industrial Vibrating feeder is also named Vibratory feeder. Industrial vibrating feeder is a kind of linear direction feeding equipment. It features smooth vibrating, reliable operation, long service life and being suitable for feeding. They are widely used in mining, building-material, silicate and chemical industry in the crushing and screening plants.</p><p>The vibrating feeder, also known as vibration feeder <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/ball-grinding-mill-equipment-in-cement-industry.html">ball grinding mill equipment supplier</a>,
 is used to transfer the large size materials and granular materials from hopper to receiving device uniformly, periodically and continuously in the production flow. It can feed materials into the crusher continuously and uniformly and can also screen the materials at the same time in the stone production line. The vibrating feeder is widely used to match the crushing and sieving equipments in many industries including metallurgy, coal mine, mineral dressing, building material, chemical, grinding, etc.</p><p>Working principle:</p><p>The vibrating feeder can make the sieve compartment, vibrators and other moving parts do the circular or similar round move by the centrifugal force produced by the rotation of eccentric block. The vibrating feeder is composed of feeding trough, exciter, spring bearing, transmission equipment, etc. The exciter is composed of two eccentric shaft (main, passive) and gear. The jogged gears create the vibrations while the two eccentric shafts are then forced to rotate by motor, through the triangular belt. Once power is supplied, the two eccentric shafts start rotating to produce leaner huge power which forces the feeder to vibrate. Through the vibration, the materials will slip and sling onto the screen moving forward. sand maker:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com ball mill:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Working principle of GZD type vibrating feeder:</p><p>GZD type vibrating feeder consists of vibrating frame, motor, spring, bearing and wear-resisting lining board, etc. due to the start of motor, the frame. is forced to vibrate on the supporting spring, which will drive the materials sliding or throwing in the trough to achieve the purpose of feeding.</p><p>Working principle of ZSW type vibrating feeder:</p><p>ZSW type vibrating feeder is composed of vibrating frame <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/iron-ore-jaw-crusher-distributor-in-indonesia.html">Iron Ore Jaw Crusher Distributor</a>,
 spring, vibrator, electrical vibrating grid, motor, etc. The exciter is composed of two eccentric shaft and gear. The jogged gears create the vibrations while the two eccentric shafts are then forced to rotate by motor. Once power is supplied, the two eccentric shafts start rotating to produce leaner huge power which forces the materials to slip forward and achieve the feeding purpose. When the materials went through the sieve on the through, the smaller materials will fall without the next crushing process to achieve the screening effect.</p><p>Working principle of GZZ type vibrating feeder:</p><p>This series product can remove the dirt, impurities of materials, and control the feeding amount to match the processing capacity during the process of transfer the large size materials uniformly, periodically and continuously in the production flow. It is the essential equipment with reliable structure, shock resistance and abrasive resistance in the complete production line and should be used before the primary crushing.</p>
