title: Development and benifits of vibrating screen in 2012 
---

<p>The vibrating screen is widely used, almost reaching every aspect of our life in processing and manufacturing various kinds of it. It is mainly used in mining, coal, smelting <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/mobile-crusher-plant-manufacturer-in-india-for-sand.html">mobile crusher plant supplier in india</a>,
 building material, refractory material, light industry, chemical industry, medicine as well as provisions etc. At present, the vibrating screen has penetrated every walk of life and brought a great deal of convenience to us at the same time.</p><p>It has been applied in metallurgy; mining <a href="">artificial stone process equipment</a>,
 building material, water conservancy and road construction. According to the statistics of the market, among these 8220 machines, 2660 belong to huge vibrating ones.</p><p>At the moment, among no more than 100 domestic producers of vibrating equipments most are small enterprises. They manufacture approximate 3000 to 4000 sets. Along with the improvement of the producing process and manufacturing technology, high capacity, high efficiency as well as the reliable checkout facility especially the screening of the material large-scale capability. Therefore, all these including the amount of the equipment, lessening vibration, decreasing the cost of the facility and management and reducing the initial investment from the equipment factory are aiming at the same target that implementing automatic detection and control. Among the 2600 sets of huge vibrating equipments, China has taken a share of 40 percent. Among the 1040 sets, only 150 sets of the facility with high capacity can be produced each year. What an amazing gap between supply and demand. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such as belt conveyor, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. hammer crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com dryer machine:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>A complete statistics shows that at present the number of heavy-duty screen manufacturer as well as parts and accessories producers has ascended to more than 400. The amount of related vibrating industries has increased gradually which paves the way for the expanding of Chinaâ€™s vibrating field.</p><p>In China Development Forum of vibration screening machines, many enterprises' representatives talked about vibrating screen innovation in machinery industry. After this forum, vibrating screen manufacturers are going to develop high value-added vibrating equipment as the new step of vibrating screen innovation.</p><p>Its Features</p><p>1. The vibrating force is very strong because the eccentric block is a vibrating source.</p><p>2. Two screen bodies are comprised of high quality materials and high strength bolts utilize a special welding technique for durability.</p><p>3. Layer quantity varies per customers' request.</p><p>4. High separating efficiency, large capacity, long life, low power consumption and little noise.</p><p>5. Two screen bodies apply a tensioning technique to fasten the screen; its simple structure makes it easy to change the screen.</p><p>6. Simple structure for convenient disassembly and screen changing.</p>
