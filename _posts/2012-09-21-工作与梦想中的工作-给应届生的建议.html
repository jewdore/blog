title: 工作与梦想中的工作 - 给应届生的建议
---

<p>我最近参加了 Big Ivy University （BIU）的招聘会，和大约50位计算机专业的本科生交谈过。他们希望能到我的公司 10gen 来实习或者正式工作。我确信他们之中有很聪明的，但是他们没有学会如何把自己和别人区分出来。在我看来这些学生有类似的建立，类似的着装，类似的语言来和我聊天。</p>  <p>    计算机系的同学们，我想告诉你们如何让自己在招聘会上脱颖而出。假如你是一个很棒的黑客，你需要告诉我们，并且把这一点写入简历。否则我们找不到你！    在学校里面学的东西是不够的    我在BIU遇到的第一个学生给我简历的时候，我发现她会Haskell，并且做了一个机器学习的项目。我觉得这很棒，并把简历放在候选中。但是当我看到第三个Haskell和机器学习的简历后，我意识到这只不过是他们课上教的内容而已。    假如你是和别的学校的学生竞争，那么你的学科内容可能是一个优势。但假如你是参加招聘会，你的竞争对手都是和你上过同样课程的学生。所以在这种情况下，你会Haskell并不吸引人，因为如果你不会的话，你就不能毕业！    我还发现所有的学生都认为GPA（学习成绩）很重要，并且都把GPA写在简历很明显的位置。但是我总是忘记去看这块内容，我相信其他公司的招聘人员也会忘记看这块内容的。    你得有魅力    也许你不屑，但这是真理。有力的握手，眼神交流，平静，友好，又有激情的语调会让你感觉和别人不同。如果你吸引我，我将和你多聊一会儿，即使还有人排队等着给我简历。我也会更认真的回答你的问题，并且问你更多的问题。这并不是歧视，因为社交能力也是公司要求的一部分。从长远来看，我们是同事，朋友，你可能面对客户，展示我们的产品等等，我们需要你有一定的沟通能力。    自己的项目，不同的语言，不同的课程    首先，如果你是计算机专业毕业的学生，你一定能找到工作，因为市场很好。但是如果你想要找一个梦想中的工作，有激情的工作，你必须在你的简历里面体现一些不一样的地方：    1. 自己的项目    如果你有一个创意，并且实现了它，那么你应该把这个放在简历的顶部，甚至在你的名字上面。然后你和我握手以后应该迅速的介绍你自己的项目。这个项目不需要很特殊，不需要盈利，功能也可以不完整，但是它代表了你做了些东西。并且说明你是有想法的人，并且热爱编程，那么你的编程水平一定不差，我会把你放在候选名单里面。    如果你还没有自己的项目，那么花点时间去做一个吧。把花在课程上的时间挪一点出来，这是值得的！然后把你的GitHub URL写在简历上。    2. 不同的编程语言    如果你会的编程语言仅限于你课程交的那些的话，说明你只是在完成作业而已。学习一门不同的语言，并不需要很小众的例如Erlang，只要不是你们上课教的就好。把这个也放在简历顶部，在你的个人项目下面。告我你是如何在暑假自学的C++，因为你想做3D图形编程来赚点零花钱。这跟我是否在招聘C++程序员无关，这让我意识到你是热爱学习计算机技术。但是要注意的是，我也许也懂这个语言的，所以如果你说你自己是精通这门语言，请确定你确实是精通。    3. 不同的课程    我知道BIU有一门选修课叫做 computer graphics，但是我只遇到一个学生上了这门课。大部分简历都列出了那些“无聊”的课程，例如操作系统，网络，Java等等。我知道你上了这些课程，否则你无法毕业。如果你想让我注意到你，上一些选修课吧。成绩并不重要。    从长远考虑    1. 参与开源项目    我并不鼓励本科生就去GitHub上寻找开源项目，然后提交代码。但是你工作几年后不同了。现在你也许意识不到现有的开源项目的不足之处，即使你意识到了也未必能提交高质量的补丁去修复这个问题。也许开始一个你自己的新项目更容易。    2. 自由职业    我并不是推荐还没毕业的学生做自由职业，去软件公司实习是一个很好的选择。我想说的是你可以做一些独立的项目，哪怕是帮朋友建立一个WordPress网站。自己做一个能有实际作用的项目，比你在公司实习的经历要有用的多。除非你真的缺钱用，否则我还是觉得你应该花店时间在你自己的项目上面。</p>  <p>原文链接，oschina.net 原创编译</p>  <p>I went to a career fair at Big Ivy University recently, and talked to fifty or so computer science undergrads who were looking for internships or full-time jobs with my employer, 10gen. I’m sure some of them were very smart, but they had not learned how to distinguish themselves from each other. One after another, these students came with identical resumes, identical suits, and identical pitches about why they should get a gig with us.</p>  <p>CS students, I want to tell you how to stand out when you’re introducing yourself at a career fair. If you’re an extraordinary hacker, you need to tell us that you are, and you need to show that you are on your resume. Otherwise we can’t find you.</p>  What You Learned In School Is Not Enough  <p>The first student I met at BIU handed me her resume, and I saw that she knew Haskell, and she’d done a machine-learning project. I thought, “cool,” and put the resume in the “call this candidate” pile. The third time I saw Haskell and machine learning, I realized that’s just what they teach at Big Ivy.</p>  <p>If you’re competing with students from other schools, then your coursework may be an advantage or a disadvantage. But if you’re coming to a career fair, you’re competing with kids who took the same courses as you. So I’m not impressed that you learned Haskell as a freshman—you’d have been kicked out of the program if you hadn’t.</p>  <p>One possibility too terrifying to contemplate is that the students I met at BIU thought their GPA mattered. If so, they’re in for a rude surprise. I know they all listed their GPAs on their resumes, but I forgot to look, and I think most employers will forget to look at GPA, as well.</p>  Charisma Matters  <p>It’s a shame, but it’s true: a firm handshake, eye contact, and a calm, friendly, enthusiastic manner make a big difference, even for nerds. I will spend more time with you, even though there are five kids in line behind you, and I will answer your questions better and ask you more questions. It’s not just that I’m biased towards charismatic people. Your social skills are part of what my company wants to hire. In the long run, if you work for us, you’ll be making friends with your coworkers, talking to customers, and presenting our products at conferences. We need you to be engaging.</p>  Individual Projects, Unusual Languages, Unusual Course  <p>Look, if you’re graduating with a CS major, you will get a job. Relax. The market’s great. But if you actually care about software and want to work somewhere that excites you, you’ll need to put some effort into your resume and how you introduce yourself. Here’s what I want to see:</p>  Individual Projects: 100 bonus points each  <p>If you had an idea for a software project and you implemented it, then you should put that at the top of your resume. Above your name. And tell me about that project as soon as you shake my hand at the career fair. The project doesn’t have to be totally unique, or profitable, or complete—just make something. Then I’ll know you have cool ideas for things to build, and that you love coding, which is highly correlated with being great at coding. You’re in the “call back” pile.</p>  <p>If you haven’t built an individual project, start. Let your 4.0 GPA slip a little. It’s worth it to make time for this project. Don’t worry about getting college credit for the time you spend, just build it. Put the GitHub URL on your resume so I can check it out.</p>  Extra Languages: 25 bonus points each  <p>If the only programming languages on your resume are the required ones, then you’re showing me you do your homework. It’s not enough. Learn an extra language. It doesn’t have to be anything exotic like Erlang, just something all your peers didn’t learn in class. Put this at the top of your resume, under the individual project. Tell me about how you taught yourself C++ over summer break because you want to do 3D graphics for a living. It doesn’t matter if I’m not looking for a C++ programmer, you’re showing me you love learning about computers. But be aware that I may know this language, too, so if you claim you’re an “expert,” you better be for real.</p>  Unusual Courses: 10 bonus points each  <p>I know Big Ivy offers a computer graphics class, but it seems like only one student took it. All the rest just listed the same boring courses on their resumes: Operating Systems, Networking, blah blah blah. I know you took those courses; otherwise you wouldn’t be graduating. If you want me to notice you, take lots of electives. Again, your GPA doesn’t matter, so don’t worry about getting a little overloaded.         </p>  Longshots  Contributing to Open Source  <p>I don’t recommend that undergrads go on GitHub seeking an open source project to contribute to. It’ll be different once you’ve been working for a few years, but right now you probably don’t have any itches that aren’t well-scratched by an existing project. Even if you do, I doubt you’re ready to write a patch that’s high-quality enough to be accepted. It’s much easier to start a new project on your own. For one thing, when you work on your own project, no one has to approve your patch.</p>  <p>Possible exceptions to this rule: Porting a package to Python 3 if no one else has started it; porting a package from a popular language to an exotic one if there’s no analogous library in the target language.</p>  Freelancing  <p>Your internships for other software companies are great, but I don’t recommend freelance work. It would probably be along the lines of setting up a WordPress site for your friend’s mother’s law firm. The level of sophistication required for your first real gig is going to stomp all over whatever summer job you get, so unless you really need the money, put your time into an individual project instead.   <em>Source: http://emptysquare.net/blog/so-youre-coming-to-a-career-fair/</em></p>
