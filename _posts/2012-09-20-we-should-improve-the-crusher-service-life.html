title: We should improve the crusher service life 
---

<p>The biggest business concern for rock crushing machines operators, undoubtedly, has to be crusher maintenance. Being able to properly run and maintain the rock breaker in order to maximize its life expectancy is an essential prerequisite. This will come from knowing the specifications. Being able to understand how much you can do and how to clean the crusher properly are the keys in extending its service life. Simply knowing when things need to be changed or replaced on the crushers will allow for increased life as well.</p><p>For increasing the service time of crusher, it is necessary to learn some skills of operational maintenance, so as to accomplish the combination of use and maintenance.</p><p>There are some methods of maintenance for crusher as follows:</p><p>The first is the preparation work before driving.</p><p>1. To check jaw plate, bearings, draw bar, supporting plate, spring and triangle belt are in good condition; fasteners are firm; Protective devices are complete; there is no barrier around the moving parts and so on.</p><p>2. To check the bearings have refueled.</p><p>3. To ensure no materials are in the crushing chamber before opening the crusher.</p><p>The start-up sequence is in turn dust collector <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/mining-equipments-for-bentonite.html">bentonite process equipment for sale</a> <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/diamond-stone-crusher-supplier.html">diamond crushing equipment</a>,

To adjust the feeding quantity of vibrating feeder, and increase from small materials to big materials, it is usually controlled the height of materials is 4/5 of the jaw chamber height. In addition, it should be also noticed that the largest particle size of materials is no more than 4/5 of the feed opening width. What’s more, when the feed particle size is continuous and uniform, the crusher can brings into play its optimal efficiency.</p><p>The development of crusher industry is quite fast, and there is a vast potential for future development in the heavy industry. At present, the popular and leading crusher in the world mostly develops on the basis of America Newell Corporation. The production and development of crusher are closely linked the scrap steel industry. At the beginning, it only handles the light and thin materials. With the development of recognition about it and the appearance of broken steel’s advantage, various standards’ crusher is developed continuously. The range of application is also more and more extensive. It even can handle the scrapped automobiles and some household appliances.</p><p>Many problems that would occur can be prevented if employees are trained properly. Employees can be trained on one-to-one basis or through a group session. Group sessions are more advisable if a new technique or process has to be imparted to employees. Employee training program should be designed in such a manner that it keeps in mind each employee's needs and current skill status. Proper training of employees increases their morale, confident in operating the crusher, their efficiency to work and decreases employee turnover which in turn lead to better working machine and an increase in profit over the long run. Employee training is not a one time job rather it should be done periodically so that each person is well equipped with the correct and updated knowledge of operating and maintenance.</p>
