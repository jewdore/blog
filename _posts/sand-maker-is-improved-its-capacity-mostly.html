title: Sand maker is improved its capacity mostly 
---

<p>Since our crusher requires high technology <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/products/auxiliary/circular-vibrating-screen.html">circular vibrating screen suppliers</a>,
 the Institute has invested huge research and development resources in its research and development. While learning advanced technologies, we also tried to make it suitable for any users according to their requirements. It is designed to serve customers with different needs. Its primary solution is to eliminate barriers brought to customers by broken sites, environment <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/impact-crusher-supplier.html">impact crusher supplier</a>,
 basic complex configuration and complex logistics operations. Basing on the new concept principle of “Processing the material near resource and destination”, we provide customers with simple, efficient, low-cost hardware facilities for project operation.</p><p>Sand makeris the main crushing machine in sand making factory. Henan Hongxing Mining Machinery Co., Ltd. is a professional sand maker androtary kilnmanufacturer with international advanced technology and modern processing equipment. The sand maker produced by our company is a new researched equipment，which has excellent performance and play a leading role in this industry.</p><p>Material falls into the fast rotating impellers from the top of the machine and crushes with material distributed around the impeller under the effect of centrifugal force. After the impact with each other, the material is crushed between impeller and cabinet and then discharged from the bottom. It can cycle many times with the close circuit and the screening device will control the granularity of finished products.</p><p>The methods to improve the capability of sand maker:</p><p>1. Regular Lubrication dryer machine:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com screen:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>The equipment of sand making needs to keep a regular lubrication. The form. of lubrication is dry oil lubrication oil. It is better to add some grease into the sand maker regularly.</p><p>2. Regular maintenance and check</p><p>It is better to have a regular maintenance and check for the sand maker, which can help the user find the negative phenomena early and make decision in time.</p><p>3. Pay attention to the starting sequence</p><p>The starting sequence has great influence on the production of stone, so it is very important to pay attention to the starting sequence. The starting sequence needs to be suitable for the whole sand making production line.</p><p>Since 2003, China's iron and steel sales has gradually increased, the demand for iron ore powder has also risen with it. As the demand increased, mineral processing plants of different levels came into being. In early <u>2005</u>, being restricted by State macro-control restrictions on steel, price of iron ore powder declined sharply. Many mineral processing plants in our country are at the edge of low profits and losses for reason of laggard beneficiation process, old rough equipment, small-scale enterprises etc. How to make the development of such enterprises profitable, competitive and mineral processing plant is an important topic facing leaders.</p><p>Under the premise of years' research on mineral processing equipment design, manufacturing beneficiation products, Henan Hongxing Heavy Machinery Factory, summed up a complete program to improve product quality, reduce production costs and improve economic efficiency.</p>
