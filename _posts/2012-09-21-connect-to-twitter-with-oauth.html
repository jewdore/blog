title: Connect to Twitter with OAuth
---

Project Setup<p>This tutorial will use a simple application called &ldquo;TwitterRush&rdquo; to demonstrate Twitter OAuth integration for the iPhone. By downloading the TwitterRush application, you will be able to precisely follow all steps in this tutorial. However, if you already have an iPhone project that you would like to connect with the Twitter API, you should still be able to follow along in your own code with only slight modifications.</p><p>In addition to TwitterRush or your own project, you will also need to download Ben Gottlieb&rsquo;s Twitter-OAuth-iPhone project available on GitHub. </p>Step 1: Copy the Twitter+OAuth Folder<p>After downloading and unarchiving the Twitter-OAuth-iPhone library, drag the folder entitled &ldquo;Twitter+OAuth&rdquo; into the &ldquo;Other Sources&rdquo; folder of the Xcode Groups &amp; Files pane. Be sure to check the &ldquo;Copy items into destination group&rsquo;s folder (if needed)&rdquo; option and click &ldquo;Add.&rdquo; </p>
