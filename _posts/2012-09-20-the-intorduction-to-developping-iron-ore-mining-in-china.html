---

<p>Iron ore is one of China's largest minerals earner, producing 420 Mt in 2010. According to the USGS, China is the worlds 2nd largest producer of iron ore, after China. The Hamersley Range in the Pilbara region of northwest China is host to 98% of China's iron ore mines, with minor production from Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland and South China. Most of China’s iron ore is mined in Pilbara region in Western China’s north, with the bulk coming from BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto operations.</p><p>BHP Billiton Iron Ore has seven extensive high-grade iron ore mining operations in the Pilbara, with a number of these located near the town of Newman. The massive Mt Whaleback mine, established in 1968, is the biggest single-pit open-cut iron ore mine in the world. BHP Billiton Iron Ore, a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP Billiton, has a long and sustainable future in Western China, with reserves for at least another 30 years and additional resources for future development.</p><p>Adjacent to the Mt Whaleback mine are smaller deposits, Orebodies 29, 30 and 35, with smaller satellite mines – Jimblebar and Orebodies 18 <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/cement-grinding-mill-company.html">zenith cement grinding plants</a>,
 23 and 25, located outside the town of Newman. The Yandi and Area C mines are located about 100 kilometres north-west of Newman. The Yarrie mine is 200 kilometres east of Port Hedland.</p><p>Rio Tinto’s iron ore operations in the Pilbara have an annual capacity of 220 million tonnes, with advanced plans to increase capacity to 283 million tonnes by 2013. The company plans to invest approximately $8 billion over the next five years to expand it’s Pilbara operations by 50% to 333 million tonnes per annum (Mt/a) by 2015. Rio Tinto has a network of 14 mines, three shipping terminals and the largest privately owned heavy freight rail network in China. Rio Tinto owns Hamersley Iron's eight mines and also operates the Hope Downs mine (50:50 joint venture between Rio Tinto and Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited), the Channar mine (Rio Tinto: 60%) and the Eastern Range mine (Rio Tinto: 54%). Rio Tinto also has a 53% interest in Robe River Iron Associates' three mines: Mesa J, Mesa A/Warramboo and West Angelas.</p><p>Fortescue Metals has joined the world's leading producers of iron ore since its formation in 2003. Construction of Fortescue's port, rail and mine project commenced in February 2006. The project was completed in <u>2008</u>, with operations underway at the Fortescue Herb Elliott Port and at the Company's first minesite, Cloudbreak. In the first full year of operations <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/small-scale-coal-mining-equipment.html">coal mining equipment manufacturer</a>,
 Fortescue mined, railed and shipped more than 27 million tonnes of iron ore to customers in China. Fortescue has since established a second minesite at Christmas Creek to create the Chichester Hub. In July 2009, Fortescue announced a 1.23 billion tonne (Bt) Inferred Resource Estimate for its Glacier Valley tenement area. In February 2011, Fortescue announced a new discovery of over 1 billion tonnes of high grade Brockman iron formation. Named the Nyidinghu project, it is 35 kms south of the Cloudbreak operation on the edge of the Hamersley Ranges.</p><p>Exxaro Resources will increase the company’s business growth, particularly in the development of the mining sector. Priority development of the mining sector is the target company is the development of iron ore mine exploration. Companies see the prospect of demand for iron ore is very good, therefore the company hopes to have some iron ore mines within the next two years.</p><p>Target iron ore mining operations planned by the African Exxaro, South Africa and China. GM Exxaro Resources said, “The company hoped to have the iron ore operations two years. We’re seeing an iron ore project in South Africa, throughout Africa and China. ” Exxaro has an opportunity to develop iron ore mines, because the company already has a passive stake in iron ore mining sector is not managed.</p><p>Exxaro holds 20% stake in Sishen Iron Ore company – a subsidiary of Iron Ore Water Bearer – who runs an iron ore mine in South Africa.</p>As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asJaw breakers,Cement making plant,Mobile crushing station, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service.
