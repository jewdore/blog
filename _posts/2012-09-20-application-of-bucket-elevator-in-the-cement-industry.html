title: Application of bucket elevator in the cement industry 
---

<p>With the expansion of the cement industry, bucket elevator has big development in traction components, delivery value, lifting height and its service life. The traction components of large bucket elevator mostly adopt belt. It is widely considered that belt has good wear resistance and had favor to increase the lifting speed as high as 3.5 meters per second. The device itself is light and operates smoothly. In domestic marker, there is a kind belt centrifugal bucket elevator that designed to 0.8 meter bucket width <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/mining-equipment/mining-equipments-for-bentonite.html">bentonite process equipment for sale</a>,
 1.55 meters per second lifting speed, maximum lifting height 30m and transmission capacity of 200 to 220 tons per hour <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/angola-iron-crusher-for-sale.html">angola crusher for sale</a>,
 which can be applied in closed-circuit powder grinding system to lift materials or cement.</p><p>The bucket width of belt bucket elevator is already 1.25m abroad and its lifting height can reach more than 100 meters. Its transmission capacity reaches 1000 tons per hour. Some countries have succeeded in the design of manufacturing folder steel belt bucket elevators with the bucket width 1.10 meters, 73 meters lifting height and the ability to transport raw materials up to 320 tons per hour. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asstone crusher, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. sand maker:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com crusher:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Now it trends to replace the pneumatic lifting equipment in the pre-decomposition of raw materials. Because the temperature of transporting materials makes limit application of bucket elevator, it is widely said that the temperature of materials must be less than 90 degrees Celsius, otherwise the heat-proof belt must be used. The heat-proof temperature of the belt can be up to 300 to 400 degrees Celsius.</p>
