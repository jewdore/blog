---

<p>The rational use of crushers:</p><ol>The input size of crushers should not exceed the size of feed port by 0.85 times. The jaw crusher must be started with no loading. The jaw crusher is suitable for the coarse crushing and medium crushing of hard and medium hard rocks and ores.</ol><p>Preparation and Check before Operation:</p><ol>The thin oil lubrication system must be first started before the startup of the crusher. After you have made sure that everything goes well, the crusher can be started. Operate the manually operated dry oil cup so as to make all the lubrication points be with sufficient oil. In the process of adding lubricating oil, check whether there exists clogging or oil leak in each oil system. Check whether all the devices are in normal operation. Check whether there exist ores or other impurities that can't be crushed in the crushing chamber. Check whether the interlocking device, light signal and safety protection facilities are fully equipped and whether they are in normal operation.</ol><p>Start-up Operation Methods:</p><ol>After all the check and preparation work has been finished, the machine can be started. Start the lubrication system <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/case/mining-equipment-for-egypt-mining-industry.html">mining equipment of egypt</a>,
 and meanwhile start the ventilation and drainage system According to the process flow, start the ore conveying system at the bottom of the crusher. Start the jaw crusher with no loading After it is in normal operation <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/aggregate-grinding-production-line.html">aggregate grinding equipment prices</a>,
 start the feeding system.</ol><p>If the crusher has to be started in section, you should strictly follow the start-up procedures.

The interlocking devices of the crusher cannot be removed in any case. Keep far away from the jaw crusher while it is in operation. Anyone should not touch the large ores or rocks in the machine with hands while the machine is in operation. If clogging occurs, the ores on the head part of the feeder should be dealt with first. Handling should start from the upper part. The use of jigger is strictly prohibited. Moreover, handling from the bottom part is not allowed as well. When dealing with the clogging of the lower hopper, you should cut off the power of both the feeder and the belt conveyor. Meanwhile, specialized personnel should be sent for on-site supervision.</ol>
