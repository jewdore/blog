title: Jaw crusher should develop rapidly 
---

<p>We learn that the continuing growth of Chinaâ€™s infrastructure investment drives the needs of the market for crushing machinery industry. Overall, ourjaw crushermarket is still in its infancy in the secondary refurbishment and remanufacturing business, and second-hand machinery market has not formed interaction with refurbished and re-manufacturing business. However, the market has been in short supply in the state, because of the relatively slow development rate of crushing machinery industry and limited design and manufacturing technology. Foreign markets <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/limestone-impact-crushing-machine-in-mine-particle-proce.html">limestone impact crushing machine</a>,
 develop more fully the market to maintain volume, there is a crisis of overproduction, in order to meet the needs of China's infrastructure construction, liberalized the import of used equipment, due to foreign crushing machinery technology is relatively mature, the price of used equipment quality Jaw Crusher relatively high cost good, was welcomed by the users, and gave birth to the formation of the secondary crusher market.</p><p>The average price of the secondary crusher is only 30-50% of the price of the new machine, used broken machinery imports have never stopped, and every year a substantial increase in the port region of Guangdong, Hainan, Henan Imports the smuggling jaw crusher almost to compete with the new machine. In 1998, the country imported second-hand dug total only a few thousand units, but the country each year of entry used jaw crusher more than 20 <a href="http://www.crushermillsupplier.com/production-line/used-rock-crushing-equipment-for-sale.html">used rock crushing equipment for sale</a>,
000 units, equivalent to 1/3 of domestic jaw crusher sales, used broken machinery market strong demand and market prospects. As the professional manufacturer of complete sets of mining machinery, such asvibratory feeder, Henan Hongxing is always doing the best in products and service. ball mills:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com mills:http://www.crushermillsupplier.com</p><p>Machinery industry analysts believe that in recent years, the old machines imported in large quantities in the rich market supply at the same time, exposed in the process of using an increasingly prominent problem of fake and shoddy, shoddy parts replaceable frequency trouble occurred, used broken machinery market chaos. Implemented on January 1 this year on the old jaw crusher import application materials forwarded to the source control of the secondary jaw crusher into the domestic market, to provide for our jaw crusher manufacturing enterprises broader space for development, used broken machinery market prospects.</p><p>It has been shown along with the country's economic development mode transformation, the social allocation of resources will be more reasonable optimization, used equipment will be the broken machinery industry in the future survival and development. Overall, the jaw-breaking which ceramists equipment crusher market in the secondary refurbishment, remanufacturing business is still in its infancy, used broken machinery market has not yet refurbished, re-manufacturing business to interact.</p>
